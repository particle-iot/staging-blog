<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  All right. Hi everybody. Welcome back to another lovely Particle interaction. This time I&#39;m hanging out with Richard Whitney, who is the Head of Product here at Particle. Super fun. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Hi, guys.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We&#39;re trying to use a new method of displaying our lovely background images. It&#39;s a little laggy.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Winter is stuck loading at twenty five percent. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> For people who don&#39;t really know what it means to be running product, can you tell us a bit about what you do at Particle? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Sure. The product role is different at a lot of different companies. It&#39;s not really a uniform thing yet. At Particle I do a lot of design work, a lot of UI/UX for the tools that you interact with. To the <a href="http://build.particle.io">Build environment</a> on the web, <a href="https://www.particle.io/dev">[Particle] Dev</a>, <a href="http://particle.io">website</a> design, graphic design, and a lot of other things. Some other things that are bit more behind the scenes are like, longer-term road map, and shorter-term decisions about what trade-offs we choose, both on the hardware and the software. My job is generally just to touch all of the things. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Sounds like you might be pretty busy a lot of the time. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I am quite busy.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> You are quite busy. Well, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Except for this hour. It&#39;s a vacation. We&#39;re in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Winter-Wonderland-background-scenes-Television/dp/B00AMT8VI2">winter wonderland</a>. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s pretty important to sometimes take time out to walk in a winter wonderland, so they say. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I&#39;ve heard that from other people. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. What does your day to day look like? It&#39;s a lot of things. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Today was largely meetings. Just to take an example. Starting around eight in the morning, and my last meeting is tonight at 6:00. Internal meetings with various teams like the firmware team, hardware and software. Some external facing ones with potential partner companies, manufacturers and customers. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> How did you get started doing this?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I don&#39;t know. &quot;Product&quot; was never a title that I really sought out. It&#39;s not something that I tried to get into. I started out doing engineering. I was a biomedical engineer and undergraduate with work on material science. Went to the <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT media lab</a> for grad school. Fun, games, fabrication, electronics and software software. User experience, psychology and a bunch of other stuff. Ran a couple of R&amp;D groups. Did a lot of product development and found myself with this odd confluence of skills which seems to work well here. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s great. We&#39;re happy that you have your odd confluence of skills. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It is helpful to us. Bearing that in mind when you have this wide reaching array of responsibilities and the things that you do-- I always ask everybody when we do this-- What does the next six months look like for your department? Your department&#39;s kind of huge, but I&#39;m going to ask you that question anyway. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Busy. Shipping <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-electron-cellular-dev-kit-with-a-simple-data">the Electron</a> is going to be one of the big things. Optimizations on that and features that we’re adding to the election are all very big. Those loom quite large in the next three months or so. Going into the new year, adding some more features to <a href="https://www.particle.io/manage">Fleet Management (or device management)</a>. More Electron stuff and then some research into future hardware things that we’re working on. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Very cool. You probably give the most succinct answers by the way. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I know. That&#39;s just me. That&#39;s the way I am. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s see. What else do we have? You developed the <a href="http://particle.io/buttonstart">Internet Button</a>. I remember when I started at Particle about a year ago. When I was interviewing, I was asking everybody, &quot;What are you working on? What&#39;s cool and exciting?&quot; You said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m building an Internet Button.&quot; I said, &quot;What does that mean?&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Should we do a reveal?</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/internet-button-cover.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Quite a while ago I started working on this little side project. This idea of a really simple demonstration of our platform that doesn&#39;t require any electronics basically. It&#39;s got the physical electronics, but you don&#39;t have to do any wiring. You don&#39;t have to understand what&#39;s going on. Very powerful and addresses a pretty large set of use cases. Particularly for people who are non-technical just to get started fast. Ended up designing this little round button which has eleven LEDs at the clock positions one to eleven, and four buttons on the other side so it works like a game pad. A little buzzer which I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually announced yet. I don&#39;t think people know that it can make music, but it can. Accelerometer, so it knows its orientation and if its been moved. Here&#39;s the big reveal. The internet comes in it&#39;s own little lovely metal can, comes in your own collector tin. Let&#39;s  see if I can get that in there good. Yeah. </p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/internet-button-uncovered.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yay.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Has a clear plastic dome over the top so you can click directly down on it. A second plastic piece which works as a diffuser. 
Even at Particle the internet goes out sometime. I hope we&#39;re still actually working here. Has this other little diffuser piece which is hard to see, but has little braille bumps on it so you know which button is which. On the underside, it has the four buttons and this little magnetic buzzer. It&#39;s not a piezo. It&#39;ll play a much wider range of tones than the whiny little piezo buzzers you&#39;re used to.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It is a really nice sound. I went from using my Radio Shack sale piezo buzzer to using this guy, and it was incredible. Big difference.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Nice. Glad you liked it. Of course, USB cable. I will get this thing set up while we talk and then run some code on it.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I really enjoy the design of this button like this little plastic cover over the cover. This doesn&#39;t get thrown out. I was really worried that people would unbox it and then throw this out. Even though it&#39;s sort of apparent that this goes to sit on top of here. Yeah. It looks really cool. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We just put up some examples through this also. I know you wrote the <a href="https://build.particle.io/libs/55e0a4256b6e3275580009ce/tab/1_Blink_An_LED.cpp">entire library for this with some cool demos</a>. Right? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s true. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Let&#39;s see. Sorry. I&#39;m doing a setup process while this is a new, never opened one. I&#39;m setting up Wi-Fi.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. Cool. You can look at it. It is flashing blue. Flashing blue is what it does when it hasn&#39;t learned any Wi-Fi networks yet. That&#39;s also known as <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#listening-mode">listening mode</a>. There&#39;s a list of all the modes on the docs. There are actually little videos that will show you what the modes are, if you ever get lost or confused. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Cool. Getting close and I&#39;m doing this via the CLI. I am currently setting things up from the command line interface installed through the app. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It&#39;s just a Photon, so you can set it up the same way that you would set it up <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/#connect-your-photon">with your phone</a>. Or <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/">serial</a>, whatever, whichever way works best for you. I think that the phone app is really easy so I often do that. I often recommend to new users to do that. Once you get really into it, though, the command line is really slick.</p>

<p>Oh man. There&#39;s so many people with Photons right now.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. There are a bunch of Photons at the house. I&#39;m going to set up somebody else&#39;s by accident. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> When you set up the Photon right now it gives you a network. The Photon makes its own little Wi-Fi network. You have to connect to it in order to do the setup process. When you set up a Photon-- this is actually part of the things you set up on your phone. It says, &quot;Go to settings, switch to the Photon&#39;s network and then come back.&quot; If there&#39;s five Photons in a room, they&#39;ll all have unique Wi-Fi networks that they&#39;re broadcasting. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Which if you look at the barcode on the bottom... Come on, crisp up. There you go. You see those four numeric digits right there? </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That says 54SC.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;ll actually tell you what the Wi-Fi name is of the Photon. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It is in barcode in case you&#39;re at a hackathon. Or you&#39;re with a bunch of people and you&#39;re trying to all set up your Photons at once. It is on the barcode. Now he&#39;s just doing the setup. I wish that we could show that, but it is on Richard&#39;s computer. Not my computer so I can&#39;t do a screenshare. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Cool. We should be setting up now. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. Look. Okay. It&#39;s still blue.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. It went back to blue. I think our local Wi-Fi network&#39;s being a little bit dodgy right now.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It&#39;s angry. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. My computer is trying to connect back to the Wi-Fi network and not connecting. We&#39;re doing bad things here. I think streaming video is the bad thing that we&#39;re doing here. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That could be. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Anyway that&#39;ll get online eventually. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s keep talking while we&#39;re waiting for that to come online. You&#39;ve had a lot of interesting experiences in tech. You did the Media Lab. You&#39;ve done a lot of R&amp;D. Obviously you&#39;re working for us here at Particle. What are you really excited to see built on the Particle platform? Is there anything that you&#39;re excited to build? Or that you&#39;re excited that other people are building?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. There are a few things. Let&#39;s see. I am really excited for more advanced tools. One of the things that we&#39;ve just started to build are... Let&#39;s call them more professional tools. Things that have GDD equivalents. GDD is this very deep technical tool for talking to microcontrollers over a JTAG. There are a bunch of those things that I&#39;d really like to have us build out. And then some other things that are related but simpler, like Serial over Wi-Fi. When you serial print on your device, it [could] just show up in the build IDE instead of connected to a serial terminal, or anything like that to make debugging easier. We&#39;ve been talking about a bunch of things along those lines that are really going to accelerate the development process. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That would be really great. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I hope so. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> What about little projects and fun things that people hack around with? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Boy, it&#39;d be a terrible idea for me to show a video on my phone to a video camera. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It would be not the best.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It would be embarrassing. Yeah. I&#39;ve actually been working with these high voltage LED filaments recently. Just as a fun little side entertainment. They&#39;re gorgeous. They look like incandescent filaments when they&#39;re on, but they take sixty volts to drive. I built a little test circuit that lets me run patterns on them with a Photon. Just recently designed a board for them so I can drive something like thirty of these little ultra high voltage filaments at once. I can do nice little light shows and stuff on a tiny little board. The total thing is so small.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Mm-hmm (affirmative). That&#39;s really cool. You&#39;ve done a lot of art shows, displays and everything in the past too. Right? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> That is true. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. You also do art. That&#39;s a part of being Richard Whitney, is doing art.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Art is an exaggeration. I&#39;ve had things in a couple of galleries. I&#39;m uncomfortable calling them art because I have friends who are actually artists-- really put in time and effort and produced these wonderful complex things. I&#39;m more of a social hacker of artists. I do things that cost me much less time and effort, but have... I don&#39;t know. Interesting impact. They use tech and so people are more enamored by them than if it were just oil and canvas. Generally participatory things, interactive art. <a href="http://consolidatedpixel.com/punchbob/">A punching dummy that when you hit it or slap it or kiss it or hug it, it takes a photo just in that instant and then projects it huge on a wall</a>. It really is a social experiment which works phenomenally well. People like to play with it, but then the social pressures of their peers change what they do with it. Guys need to look strong, but not violent. Women need to look playful, but not strong. These really odd things that come out of the group interactions.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/punch-bob.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Huh. That&#39;s pretty interesting. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. Good. You should build some weird Particle, interactive things.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I know and I&#39;ve been infecting some other artists with Photons. There are some people who are going to be building interesting things in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Do you have advice? Standard advice for artists who are trying to become more technical and well-versed in Internet-of-Things-type art?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Work with Photons. It&#39;s way easier. By the way, someone-- community-- please help us. Someone should write us a good OSC library for the Photon. OSC is open sound control. It&#39;s a communication protocol. It used a lot by artists to do control over various musical things and graphical things. There are a lot of really nice apps already out there for it. It&#39;d be kind of a little thing that runs on your phone to your control... I don&#39;t know. Complex stuff that&#39;s really easy to rough out. It&#39;s mostly visual programming for simpler artists, but then deeper control. You can enter it into SuperCollider if you&#39;re doing generative music and some other things that we should really get on. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. We should do that. If we have more artists in our community, I&#39;d love it if you guys were watching to make that kind of thing happen. Reach out to us and to Dick on the Community who is at @Dick on the community. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s true.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Easy to get ahold of him that way. Let&#39;s see. Speaking of libraries, we are doing currently some work to identify libraries. Right? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. We&#39;ve got a bunch of things coming together right now. We&#39;ve gotten a script written that goes through, checks the examples and all libraries for Core and Photon compatibility. We now have a list of whose libraries don&#39;t work with the core or the proton and what the compile errors were. If you get an email from me, I&#39;m trying to solve that. There are a couple of broad categories that the failures fall into. I&#39;m currently putting together emails. Running emails that&#39;ll tell you how to fix that problem. Instead of just a general, &quot;Your thing is broken,&quot; I&#39;m sending you very specific directions on, &quot;It is probably this.&quot; &quot;You fix it by changing this code to this, so it should be really quick.&quot; A few people have gotten pull requests from me over the last few days. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s great. Hopefully that whole issue gets resolved pretty soon. I&#39;ll also make sure that I release a list as we go forward of the libraries, if there&#39;s some that we can&#39;t get fixed that have become orphan libraries, so that we can get everything up to date. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. We don&#39;t want any sad little orphan libraries. They should all have wonderful, caring parents that really spend time with them. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Hey it looks like your button&#39;s online. Look at this.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It is. Did I flash code to that yet? </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Here we go. Happy, breathing cyan. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Well. I should target it. Let&#39;s see. What do I need next?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Now we&#39;re looking to see which one this guy is. You can usually tell this by who&#39;s online. What Dick is doing right now is he&#39;s refreshed his Build page so that he can see this device being online. There will be a little pulsing, cyan dot next to it when it is online. If you have five devices online, all of them will have pulsing dots next to them. If you just claimed one and you haven&#39;t named it then your one would be the one that says, &quot;New device,&quot; with no name. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I am the lucky owner of one of our test suites of devices. I tend to have a lot more devices online than other people, which takes a little bit more looking through. They all have cute names based on the emoji stickers that I&#39;ve stuck to their cans. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. Yeah. You have one named MoneyBags, right?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I do. I have MoneyBags which is like a little money sack. I&#39;m currently looking at who&#39;s online. Kitty&#39;s online, Puppy&#39;s online, Pineapples is online. Pow is not online, but should be. I think that&#39;s just temporary.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh look, purple. That&#39;s the code coming in over the air?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yep. Yeah. That should be pulling the 0.4.4 update right now. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> This is going to take a little bit longer.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Okay. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Since this is the first time I&#39;ve flashed code to this new device, it&#39;s also downloading our latest firmware. This is something we&#39;ll probably change in the near future. Currently when it first comes online it&#39;ll get the 0 update, which puts it on 0.4.2 maybe, from our version for our system firmware. Since I&#39;ve just flashed code to it and it would really like to be running 0.4.4, it is now downloading new system firmware for that version. Which is our lovely, new modular firmware. This will probably take as many as like... Well with what we&#39;re doing to the internet here and how its been behaving, it might take a little bit longer. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Did I mess it up?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s fine. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It went really quiet all of a sudden. No. It&#39;s fine. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. There&#39;s a fun experiment you can do with your device. You absorb RF really well. If you wrap your hands around your device you can make it go offline. Because people are big bags of water and water absorbs 2.4 gHz really well. When I&#39;m actually testing low connectivity like low signal strength behaviors, that&#39;s one of the standard things that I do. I just wrap my hands around it, see if it drops out and see how it behaves.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s pretty good advice for when my-</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> For doing bad things to your device?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I should definitely stop trying to give my Photon a hug when it&#39;s not finding the internet. It&#39;s not very encouraging for it.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Right. It&#39;s not that it&#39;s sad. It&#39;s that you&#39;re a big bag of water. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s see. What else do I have? Anything that you&#39;re really excited to get fixed as a product person in the next couple months? Yeah. Everything? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. When you find things that annoy you, do let me know. Also assume that I&#39;m already annoyed about them and that I&#39;ve put it on someone&#39;s road map. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. Yeah. You were working on a really big, beautifully laid out road map.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yep.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> So that everyone has visibility into everybody else&#39;s stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yep.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s going to be really huge. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. That is together. I need to update it later this week. That&#39;s to let everyone understand how the different parts of the stack interact because we have a very complex product. This isn&#39;t a nice, compact thing all written in one language or running on one server. This is hardware design, firmware design and several different cloud services. Front-end and other services that we&#39;re spinning up currently. Business deals that have to go through, contracts are being negotiated. All of those things really have to dovetail together at the right time for everything to work smoothly. Yeah. It&#39;s a pretty important thing to make sure everyone understands.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. That sounds very complex to handle and to display as information for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah, but then I put nice gradients on it and it&#39;s less threatening.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I saw that when we were doing docs, you put together the graphic. Right? Of the update sequence for the Photon.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> There&#39;s a nice graphic on the docs of what happens when you get your Photon because a lot of lights go off, once you get it online. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. There are quite a few different parts of the pattern. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. They did a really nice graphic showing the light sequence that you&#39;re going see over time. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. The blink patterns. You get to blinking cyan and then it goes blinking pink again (or magenta).</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah and same for the user modes. You can put into three different modes. There&#39;s safe mode which is blinking pink. For those of you who don&#39;t know, hold down the <code>SETUP</code> button and then tap the <code>RESET</code> button. Let go of the <code>MODE</code> button or <code>SETUP</code> button (we&#39;ve changed [the button&#39;s name] from the core [from <code>MODE</code> to <code>SETUP</code>]). When you&#39;re on the mode you want the first mode is... a breathing magenta mode and that&#39;s <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#safe-mode">safe mode</a>. It&#39;ll still get online. We&#39;ll be able to flash code to it, but it won&#39;t run your user code in case you put something on there that SOS&#39;s. Or had some other problem where it&#39;s blocking. That makes it a lot easier just to put fixed code on it. The next one is blinking yellow. That&#39;s DFU which let&#39;s you do low level programming and a couple of other interesting things. The next one is blinking green, which wipes the user code off. Wipes the user code, but keeps the Wi-Fi credentials. [This mode has been removed from the Photon. We recommend that you reset the wifi credentials <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#wifi-network-reset">this way</a>.]</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m pretty sure it does that as well. Alex just wrote that we forgot to Tweet about this. I am now putting this up.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> On the Twitters?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> On the Twitters. All right. That looks like a reasonable Tweet. Right? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yes. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> All right. Let&#39;s go Tweet. Cool. Looks good.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Alex says, &quot;Wi-Fi scan library please.&quot; Yes. That is actually a thing that Matt has been working on. I believe there may be an improved design for that now. I believe that&#39;s happening soon. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I would be delighted if that were a thing because I actually just got a message from one of my friends the other day. She&#39;s doing development for this thing at Harvard Medical School. She said that they wanted to build the Wi-Fi connected Hobbit sword so that they can use it to see unsecured networks.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. It&#39;s funny because that meeting was yesterday morning at 8:00am. We definitely talked about how it would fix the Warsting library. That&#39;s in the works.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Cool. Let&#39;s see. All right. Your dude is now breathing magenta. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Let me see. You keep talking. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> If people want to post questions now you should feel free and welcome to do that. We will answer those and then play around with the Internet Button a little bit more, if we have time for that too. Yeah. Usually because there&#39;s such a huge lag it takes a minute for any questions to pop up.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Cool. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s see. Garrett wanted to know: Will you be sharing your LED filament project on Hackster or anything? Yeah, will you?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I&#39;m not a sharing kind of person. Yeah. I&#39;ll put those up once they&#39;re together. There are a couple other things that I&#39;d like to get built into it. It&#39;s funny because I was looking at the design and realized that I hadn&#39;t actually put in a power switch or a couple of other things. Minor tweaks before I actually do a run of some boards.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Will wrote, &quot;Bring back Will.&quot; Will, you get to do this in a couple months because we cycle everybody. We will bring back Will soon-ish. Yeah. Garrett said, &quot;Needs more hats.&quot; I did offer you a hat, to be fair.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> You did. Yeah. I subscribed to the David Attenborough school of hats, which is very much: Unless you will die without it, you should not wear a hat.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Whoa. Is that an actual philosophy of David Attenborough? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Well yeah. Look at him in every extreme environment, never wearing a hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/xR-yMiyquG4?t=11m42s">The only time I&#39;ve ever seen him with any kind of head gear on is in the dry dessert of Antarctica.</a> You&#39;re so far inland and it&#39;s so cold, but there&#39;s no snow or anything. That’s the only time he&#39;s had head gear on that I&#39;ve noticed. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s pretty intense. Oh. Alex is asking, &quot;What are some ideas for multiple Photon projects?&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I really like David&#39;s <a href="/2014/12/12/holiday-lights">Cheer Lights</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. That was fun. </p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/20141212/tree_crop.png"></div>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It was of the simpler things, but it&#39;s so great. It&#39;s an Internet Button that when you click it, makes other Internet Buttons sparkle with Christmas color. You have one and your friend have them. When one person clicks everyone gets a little bit of cheer.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That was really lovely. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It was nice. I also like some of the more practical projects. Automatic lock control and gate control stuff. You&#39;ve got a gate that you have to buzz people in on at your apartment. You just have a button that does it. When somebody rings your doorbell you can just hit your Internet Button and it goes. There would be Photon down there that runs the electronic strike, the solenoid in there. Another one upstairs to receive your button clicks. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;ll be useful. That sounds like something you might have experience in. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Denial knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Previous life experiences. What is the best way to do batteries for development and production? How do I make a battery last its longest?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. That is a long and deep conversation. Batteries for development... For early prototypes I really just like to plug the USB into one of the phone batteries-- the USB phone charger battery things-- because it&#39;s so quick. Actually one of the standard ways that I do demos now is to buy an OTG cable. I can plug it into my phone and then I plug another USB cable into this little adapter, which runs into my Photon. My phone&#39;s battery provides my Photon with the power. I tether the Photon to my phone’s internet. Now I&#39;ve got this thing where I don&#39;t have to rely on any local internet or power.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That is probably the way that I should also be doing demos. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s really effective as long as you&#39;re not in an interior room, in a concrete building. Then you&#39;ll do pretty well. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s great. Yeah. I usually do carry a giant battery around with me. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I&#39;ve got this monstrous brick that&#39;s like ten thousand million amp hours.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Keeping the radio off is pretty important with Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi just as a protocol is extremely power intensive. I don&#39;t know. No matter who&#39;s chip you&#39;re using, no matter what platform you&#39;re on, Wi-Fi just likes power. It will pull it really as much as it can. By as much as it can I mean eighty to a hundred million amps, which is a lot over longer periods of time. [You should be] turning the radio off and only turning it on when you actually have something to publish, or when you want it to surface. Receive some data look or commands that are waiting and then go back down. That&#39;ll really make the batteries last a lot longer.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Will wants to know what&#39;s your favorite part about your job? What is the most stressful part?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Can they both be Will? </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Will, can they? I don&#39;t know if he can hear me. He&#39;s downstairs probably.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Well he may have his head phones on.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s also true. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Let&#39;s see. Favorite part of my job is actually my co-workers.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Awww.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. No. It really is. Not even as a joke. It&#39;s just like, &quot;I really like the people I work with.&quot; Most stressful part is manufacturing China. I know that just seems like it shouldn&#39;t be that big a deal. Things always change and they always change in unexpected ways that you haven&#39;t seen before. You are always QA&#39;ing and covering for the problems.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Will just yelled, &quot;No,&quot; from downstairs.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I assumed that&#39;s when Will heard us from earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I think there&#39;s pretty serious lag. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s a really long delay.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let&#39;s see.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> We did not crack the Amazon dash devices yet, but other people have. It seems likely that they&#39;re software compatible with our platform, which is interesting. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. There are probably some links somewhere of all these. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. There are. If you look for “Amazon dash hack,” there are a couple of good tear-downs. And it&#39;s a beautifully designed device. That is a really cleverly designed thing. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Julien wants you to post the OTG plus tether trick to the community forum.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Sure. Yeah. It&#39;s like a two dollar adapter off Amazon and just totally great. Oh. By the way, this has been sitting quietly, waiting for our attention. You can kind of see the little LED&#39;s dance around as I click things. Let&#39;s see what other code is in this one. It&#39;s one of my many little demos. I never know which ones have music or other stuff. There it goes. That&#39;s rainbow.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s pretty. Rainbows.</p>

<p>Yeah. These are really easy to use. I was so excited when I was playing with this. Also they look so slick now because for a while, I had just the v1 button that was raw and it didn&#39;t have--</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. Well that&#39;s also just a lot of the shiny plastic off too because, come on, if you’re listening to this, you&#39;re interested in the nitty gritty part. Lovely new matte black silk screen. Come on camera, focus. Pretend like this is really here. There you go.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Nice matte black. A few little hidden features. There were complaints about me not having an LED at twelve. I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t actually put one there and have the plastic fit. Here is an unpopulated neo pixel pad. You can just plop one down and it&#39;ll work. On the back you can see that there&#39;s an unpopulated JST, if you happen to want to plug a battery into it. There you go. You can also tap directly into the ground in VM lines through the header there. The hole in the middle is meant to let you screw it down to something. You can actually drop a hole through here, put the plastic back on and then put the Photon back into that. Leave it screwed to a surface so it&#39;ll be permanently mounted or semi permanently mounted. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s so exciting. Yeah. I did get a lot of questions. Whenever I show these to people they ask, &quot;Why this guy is empty?&quot; The answer is you can put a thing there. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. The answer is this. The answer is you need to have that little channel that you really can&#39;t see. Let me put my hand behind it. You have to have that little channel in the platform so that the USB can plug in. It&#39;s just a combination of stack up thicknesses that require it to have that. The other cute little feature here is that if you plug your Photon in, then you still have that extra row of headers out to either side. Let&#39;s see if we can make that focus. Come on, just for me. Yeah. You have these extra rows of headers which have dual headers underneath them. You can just plug jumper wires directly in and it mirrors out all the pins in the Photon. I actually use the buttons as a starting point for wider projects. I&#39;ll plug a sensor directly into here. A distant sensor and then display the distance on the LED&#39;s because I&#39;m always trying to startup something. Or test some new sensor or some new actuator. </p>

<p>I like having a quick way to get into it. Also buttons so I can interact with it and LEDs so I can see what&#39;s really going on. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I like the buttons. This is a tangential, fun story of when I first started working at Particle. Dick and I were hanging out at the office. I had never really done that much stuff with electronics before. He handed me a box that was just all buttons. He was like, &quot;Push all these buttons and tell me which ones you think are the best.&quot; There was just an array of buttons laid out on the table, ranked by which ones were the most fun to press. It&#39;s those kinds of things you think about when you do new product.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yes. There&#39;s a particular industrial button that is my favorite. It just feels the best. It’s got this crunch to it.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I remember that button. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. They&#39;re big and they&#39;re expensive. I&#39;ve had previous art collaborators just take them and never give them back. I need to find a new source. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. It&#39;s funny. Let&#39;s see. There&#39;s a comment about Slack team. We&#39;ll get it up. I had a holdup for it other week, but I expect that to come up in the next month. I&#39;ve had several people asking for that now. Let&#39;s see. What else have we got? I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m overly succinct. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> You&#39;re very succinct. I didn&#39;t have this problem when I interviewed Will. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I know. Well it&#39;s actually a thing that English teachers complained about in high school too. They&#39;re like, &quot;Uh no.&quot; &quot;Half a page is not enough.&quot; &quot;I asked you to write three pages.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;But I was done.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> “I was done at half a page.” </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I said the things I wanted to say. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I&#39;m going to plug this guy back in. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Cool. I&#39;ll make it play music if you want. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh! Oh my gosh! Kenneth is posting a question! When will you be heading over to China and checking out the manufacturing process? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh man. I was actually planning to back in January or something like that, but we were just so busy. I need to renew my visa. Sometime.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Sometime you will go over?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I spent a lot of time in a different part of China for a different company. I hear that Shenzhen in all is just way more fun. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Why is it more fun? What are you hearing?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> The part that I was in is just way out in nowhere. There are no expats. There is no expat supporting community. You are the only non-mandarin speaker there. They had a very strong local dialect. Even other mandarin speakers have a lot of trouble with them. Which is really funny when you&#39;re watching a negotiation between two people. It&#39;s just very odd. A combination of terrible weather and the extremely high stress of trying to get a product out. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I know that Will wants us all to take a trip to Shenzhen. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> To hangout and see the manufacturing process. Maybe sometime.</p>

<p>Look-- I plugged it back in because I was excited. The thing that I like about this demo is that remembers where the last LED that was pressed. That&#39;s where the little light comes from. Didn&#39;t somebody make a game with one of these?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. There are a couple of little games and I sort of expected more. We had produced a thousand of the prototype ones and a batch for Instructables and for a couple of workshops and things. This is the first time that they&#39;re really getting out to a wider audience. I&#39;m expecting more fun, interesting things. Games are definitely one of those things I&#39;m expecting. Yeah. Let&#39;s see. Where&#39;s my music code? </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. Yeah. Flash that. Let&#39;s see. Gary wants to know what is your favorite Particle story?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> You don&#39;t know?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> No. I really don&#39;t. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> They&#39;re all great?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Well I&#39;m like mildly memory damaged now because I been in meetings all day.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. That happens.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. It really does. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I have fond memories of lots of things, but no good stories that come to mind right now.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Not really a story, but the fact that you basically created an unofficial reading list for everyone at Particle, by recommending the same two books to everyone. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Oh. Yeah. The next round of things... It&#39;s starting. I&#39;m infecting people with more books.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> More books?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I read a lot and I&#39;m particular about what I read. When I find something that&#39;s really good then I just force it on a lot of friends. A lot of people at Particle have read this thing called <a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/">Worm</a>. And-- this is great-- <a href="http://hpmor.com/">Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</a>. If you haven&#39;t heard of it, laugh all you want, but it&#39;s fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> This was one of the first things that you said to me when we were hanging out was, &quot;Have you read Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality?&quot; I was like, &quot;What is that?&quot; I thought it was like an explanation of Harry Potter which, it&#39;s not NOT an explanation of it.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> No. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a retelling of the story with Harry Potter, the character, as a slightly different person. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It&#39;s really good. I read through it really quickly after that. It&#39;s great. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> You read through all two thousand pages or so really quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I did. I like to read. Kevin wants to know how hot is in here? It&#39;s really hot.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Kevin, it&#39;s pretty warm. It is not the warmest I&#39;ve ever been in a meeting, but it is not that cool. You notice I&#39;m actually making really fast progress on my water. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> a2retro asks, &quot;I just ordered two Photons and a programmer, how long until system threading is ready?&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Okay. You&#39;re really looking for multi threading right? The current plan-- don&#39;t hold us to this. Is that a beta of multi threading is likely to start at the beginning of next week. That&#39;ll be a beta. It&#39;s not full production. Yeah. You should be able to play with it pretty soon. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Does Particle attend and host hackathons often and do we do it outside of the Bay Area?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Depends on your definition of often. Every other month maybe.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I feel like there&#39;s a lot of events that we sponsor. We sponsor a lot of events. You see Photons and Cores floating around at a lot of events. In terms of ones where you might actually see somebody from Particle, it&#39;s less often. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. If you count JS events. NodeJS and stuff. At least every other month. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. Every other months sounds about right to me in terms of when we physically go somewhere. We do want to do more of that. That&#39;s also something that I&#39;ve been thinking about lately. If people have ideas of meetups that they&#39;d want-- [starts laughing at Will’s question].</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I don&#39;t if Will&#39;s question is for me or for Christine.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It&#39;s got to be for you.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I think it&#39;s a nudge that I need a haircut because it is getting just way too long.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Maybe it&#39;s not a passive aggressive question. It could just be that he thinks that your hair is amazing. The question was who cuts your hair it&#39;s amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Will knows that I cut my own hair.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Wait, how do you cut your own hair?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> With my hands.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Well, all right. I didn&#39;t think that you built a magical hair cutting robot. Although I imagine if you did you would have built it on the Particle platform. An internet-connected hair cutting robot.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yes. You just send it photos that you want it to look like and then it figures out what that hairstyles going to be. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Other people can upload instructions to the hair cutting robot. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Security implications of that are terrifying. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. They&#39;re really scary. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;ve been cutting my own hair since college. I started to do it because I was cheap at the time. Since then I&#39;ve never found a barber that I thought did as good a job as I did. About once a year I try a new barber and I&#39;m just never happy with the results. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Wow. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Deep insights.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> How much do you guys play around with Particle for your personal projects?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. All the time actually.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> All the time. Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s one of those things that I&#39;ve been thinking about a lot. Really trying to make sure that we get more Photons and things in people&#39;s hands. I build a lot of projects at home. I really do. In part because I always have at least one Photon around. I&#39;ve always got somewhere to work from. I&#39;ve always got that starting point within easy arms reach and some old code that I can hack at to get started. I built a pull up bar sensor just recently. There is actually an internet button mounted on the door frame above the pull up bar, with a little distant sensor below. When you do a pull up it sees your face. It counts up and makes a little noise every time. It has multiple players.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/pull-up-bar.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> My housemate and I actually have separate accounts with different colors. I just click the button to choose me or click the button to choose him. Do a set up pull ups and then it reports it to librato. There&#39;s a graph of how many pull ups each of us have been doing. It&#39;s a huge motivational tool. I actually went ahead and mounted the tablet next to it. We&#39;ve always got the graph up so when you walk through that door you&#39;re like, &quot;Nyargh!! Aaron, you&#39;ve been doing more pull ups while I was gone!&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We should probably do that in the office for something. I don&#39;t know if it has to be pull ups. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Taking the trash out. I would be happy if we did it for that. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. You get five hundred satoshis every time you take the trash out. Let&#39;s see. Yes, Garret I do watch Mr. Robot. Someone mentioned the Tyrell comparison recently which was really odd. Yeah. Anyway I was surprised.</p>

<p>[Next question--] Fun stories about the <a href="http://thingscon.com/">trip to Germany</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It was fun. We went to a beer garden.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. We went to the beer garden.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That was cool.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> What? Two or three times.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Well it was just the activity after the days when we were at the conference. Everybody went over to the beer garden. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It was really good.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It was really good. This was ThingsCon which is just a awesome conference. Really smart people, interesting folks. Yeah. Enjoyed it a lot. Oh. What was the other story? Oh. Met a guy named Simone who talked about ethical things and how when you write code your personal biases really show up in your code. The decisions that you put into your code reflect your personal philosophies and I referenced them at a talk last week. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Hmm.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> What&#39;s an example of that?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> The extremes are the interesting ones to look at. Imagine the programmer of your lights, let&#39;s say, was extremely environmentally minded. They write in this bias where your lights aggressively turn themselves off. Or imagine if the Nest had this very green mindset. Instead of trying to set a comfortable temperature, it was trying to save energy and it was always biased in that direct. It was always turning the temperature down when it was cold out and up when it was hot out. I think it plays out in a lot of other subtle ways. There&#39;s been a lot of discussion of morality and autonomous vehicles recently. That&#39;s a really interesting debate. What is the correct choice for an AI to make? I think it comes out in other subtle ways. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Moors7, who everybody knows from the community as one of our wonderful elites, just asked if we have hackathons internally. If so, what is the most amazing thing that came out of that? I&#39;m laughing because he has been to some of our internal hackathons. We don&#39;t do it as much as I wish we did. There was another question on here about our dev evangelism and how we need to get better at it. It&#39;s true. We should. The thing is that we have a really small team actually. People don&#39;t realize we&#39;re still less than thirty people on our team. It&#39;s little. We don&#39;t get to do the stuff that we think is the most fun as much as we want to because we&#39;re always tied up doing twenty other things. Which you&#39;re very experienced with.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Well yeah. Sometimes we&#39;re taking out the trash.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I did that earlier today.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> You&#39;re welcome. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I&#39;ll give you five hundred <a href="http://www.btcsatoshi.com/">satoshis</a> later. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Don&#39;t play into the satoshi inflation. I was kidding. Yeah. In terms of internal hackathons there are a couple of things that we&#39;ve been talking about doing. Yeah. Hopefully we&#39;ll get to some of the fun group projects.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> At one of the internal hackathons, we built <a href="/2014/12/17/warsting-a-wifi-scanning-sword-for-hobbits/">Warsting</a> actually.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. During that one we built Warsting and this Photon counter. Which is this giant seven segment display over one of our windows, that shows how many Photons have been sold. Oh. Yeah. Actually we&#39;re talking about sending a team to the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I was just talking to Steph about that earlier today. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. Actually entering our own team as well as doing some sponsorship. I&#39;ve been talking about doing that for a while. I think it&#39;d be fun if a group of us, just for fun, went to hackathons and helped out the other teams. Also it&#39;s something really cool that we&#39;ve been thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I would like that. I feel like it&#39;s a good opportunity to just hangout as a team as well and do team bonding. A comment on the Photon counters. After the last Particle Interaction with Will, we had gone over all of the different-- I don&#39;t know if you were here for this-- We had gone over all the different reposts that people can submit pull requests to. How you can actually go into them, check it out, see how it&#39;s built and change things. Somebody who I will not name, but who knows-- Yeah. Okay. He actually commented, &quot;The Photon counter was really easy to set to whatever I wanted.&quot; It was Alex. Alex went in and set it to a random number. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Is he the reason I&#39;m seeing weird numbers now?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It was amazing. We loved it. It was so funny. I was really pleased that someone was watching.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Well it&#39;s one of those places that we don&#39;t really spend security time on. I don&#39;t really care what number you put up, as long as you can&#39;t reprogram the device. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I would really like it if somebody would actually send us messages. You send out messages through the Photon counter and just be like, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That would be kind of interesting. </p>

<p>“Do we still have a giant L3D cube from Maker Fair?” Yes. Kevin answered that.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. We do have the monstrous <a href="http://lookingglassfactory.com/">L3D cube</a>. It is beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It is very large. It is so cool.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> It&#39;s four thousand ninety six LED&#39;s. RGB LED&#39;s. Multiply that three for the number of channels and it&#39;s just sick. Yeah. We do actually need to find a better place to put it. Right now we have it in a hallway. Yeah. We need somewhere nicer for that.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. We&#39;re probably going to change offices as soon. Were in such a big transition period right now in terms of physical locations. I&#39;m hoping that in our next office they won&#39;t have to move the furniture around the conference room to do this every time. We&#39;ll see. It will be exciting.</p>

<p>“It was a different number every second - Alex.” Talking about what he did to the counter. The great thing about when we discovered that the counter was hacked is we were looking up and we thought that maybe there was just something wrong with it. We were like, &quot;What happened?&quot; &quot;Why does it keep displaying weird numbers?” We kept resetting it, trying to figure it out. We&#39;re like, &quot;Oh. Oh okay. This is what happened.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Nice.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It was the greatest. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Yeah. Let me tell you guys the greatest accidental prank that I have heard recently from a Photon user. I was looking at a thing someone had built. Let me pull this apart again. They had a little light sensor. Actually the one that comes with the Photon kit. It&#39;s plugged into A0 just like normal position. It totally makes sense. They&#39;re doing an analogue read on it, bad data. Just couldn&#39;t get it to change. They&#39;d put some wires in differently and try to pull it to three point three volts. They get the maximum value down to the ground to get zero. Nothing. They said that it was working yesterday and all this other stuff. I&#39;m probing with a multi meter. I&#39;m hooking it up different ways and I&#39;ve got it jumpered to another circuit. I&#39;m like, &quot;Well let&#39;s connect directly to the Photon and see what&#39;s up. Let&#39;s just make sure that there&#39;s no bad connection problem with the header or anything.&quot; I pull it out and the header is in here pretty tight. It&#39;s actually a little bit difficult to work it out because it should be like that. </p>

<p>When I pull it out, it slips out easily like it&#39;s just not even in. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh.&quot; &quot;That was a little bit odd. I wonder if they got a button with badly soldered headers or something.&quot; I look at it and the header pins in the Photon are shorter. They&#39;re about half the length. For some unknown reason these people had cut the header pins shorter. They had cut the header pins down for some other thing that they were trying to fit it in or do something with. It wasn&#39;t making any contact with the headers and it was just totally invisible. They basically short sheeted a Photon on me. So, just, do it to your friends. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That would be a pretty mean prank. If I just did that to all of your internet buttons when you were looking.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Please don&#39;t. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I won&#39;t cut all of the pins. I&#39;ll just cut a couple of random ones. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Just some of them. Just so like my accelerometer stops working or something.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. Just a couple.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh my God. It took forever to figure out.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That&#39;s fun times. Yeah. These are good little buttons. I hope that people do more projects with the internet buttons so that I can play with them.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I hope that people do things with the tins that they come with.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I still think that looks like a candy tin.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I know. I understand that that&#39;s your childhood.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I like it. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I really like the little matchboxes for the Photons. I really want us to be creating packaging that people use for other stuff. It&#39;s not just junk. You use it to carry your device around later or to put parts in or to do something with. Stuff that&#39;s not just garbage. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I like this. It feels strong. It feels lightweight. It has a little clear front panel. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. The window is really nice. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Kevin wants to know if you can offer advice for someone wanting to get into IOT or Particle, what advice would you offer?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Hmm. [Reading responses on the screen.] Yep, exactly Alex! My current advice is get going with the button. That&#39;s really what I designed it for. It&#39;s easy for other people to get started, especially when you&#39;re using the library. The library abstracts a lot of the more complex functions. It has neopixels, but instead of making a bunch of the neopixel calls-- there&#39;s usually several function calls you need to make just to turn the LED on. But with the button you say, &quot;LED on, which LED and what color you want it to be&quot; and it just goes.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> What do you think is the next step after the Internet Button? Is there going to be an internet button&#39;s older sibling kind of thing?</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. That&#39;s interesting. We got a couple of questions about if we&#39;re going to make an internet button for the electron. That&#39;s tough because the electron is seven pins longer. It&#39;s a much bigger thing. About fifty percent again longer than the Photon, which would make a very large button. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m thinking about that a bit. After these have been out in the wild for a little while, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll get some really good suggestions about changes to make. Next generation button is up in the air. Let&#39;s see.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Garrett wants to know if this is UV protected. If you could just put it in like a solar panel and see it? </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I don&#39;t know. I actually don&#39;t know what plastics being used there. I couldn&#39;t tell you. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It could be fine. You should test it, Garrett. Let us know.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. It makes a pretty good seal when you screw it down. Yeah. Kevin says, &quot;More LED&#39;s.&quot; The reason I didn&#39;t put more is that the eleven RGB LED&#39;s, the eleven neopixels at full brightness stayed just below-- plus the Photon and Wi-Fi-- It all stayed just below the USB standard for power consumption. You won&#39;t have your computer complaining if you&#39;re powering it off of your USB cord. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. I didn&#39;t know that.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. That&#39;s one of the reasons that it&#39;s the number it is. Also because clock positions, then it&#39;s easy to talk about. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. That&#39;s a funny idea. Garret says, &quot;You should make a giant Internet Button kind of like the giant Spark Core,&quot; which is outside. I&#39;ll put a picture of this in the blog post if I can find one. We have a giant core that used to be used at demos and events. Where people could light up the different pins on the core which are represented by light bulbs.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/giant-core.jpg"></div>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah, with these big Edison bulbs. It&#39;s run off of four relay shields. It&#39;s pretty funny.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That would be a good idea if we had a giant internet button. A Frisbee-sized internet button that you could just-</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Oh. Frisbee-size is great. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That would be hard.</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> If it were the scale of the giant Core, it would be out of control.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> I like things that are easy to move. That giant Core is big enough to be a pain. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Oh. That&#39;s a really good question. “Will the electron be sold as a separate module like the P1?”</p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> That&#39;s a good question Edward. It will not because the electron doesn&#39;t have all of the components in one can. The P0 and P1 have both the microcontroller and the radio in a single component. With the electron it&#39;s more similar to the design of the core, where there is a cellular module and a microcontroller separately. It&#39;s a little tricky. It also means that the component count... Especially the things like the SIM card slot is higher. We could make the single sided board like we did with the Photon. For the immediate future electrons are going to be pretty much just plugged into sockets only. We&#39;ll of course put you in touch with the suppliers if you want to buy all the components. You can make your own using our designs. You can take our eagle designs, drop them into your PCB and that&#39;ll work great.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Cool. We&#39;re at about 5:00 now. Usually that&#39;s as much time as I take up. This was really fun. You should come back and talk to the community again. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;ll talk to us. It&#39;s really odd because what we see is live stream of ourselves on the laptop below the camera. Which is why I keep making eye contact with the wrong place because I&#39;m looking at us, instead of at the camera. I was having that conversation with our doppleganger selves, slightly out of phase. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. Let&#39;s do that again. </p>

<p><strong>Dick:</strong> Yes. Okay. Future selves, past selves.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Okay. See you next time future selves/entire community. Have a good one.</p>
