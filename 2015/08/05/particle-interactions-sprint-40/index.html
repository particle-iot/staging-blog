<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Hello everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  All right. We&#39;re going to have one of these every couple of weeks. We&#39;re going to do them per sprint. As I explained on one of the threads on the Community, we have been doing these 2 weeks sprints since the inception of Spark, now Particle. So, we&#39;re going to kick this off with our wonderful CEO Zach Supalla in this incredibly sweltering room.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   It&#39;s really warm in here. San Francisco is not supposed to be this hot, but it is warm and we are baking in our office, yeah. It is warm. Hunter is now passed out because of how warm it is.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Hunter is our mascot.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Hunter is our mascot.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Zach, I would love if you could just give us a rundown of where we are right now in the world of Particle.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   The big thing for us is we are now shipping the Photon. The Spark Core came out mid-2013 on Kickstarter. We shipped at the end of 2013. This is our big second product. We just started shipping it about a month ago. We&#39;re getting them out into the world. Some tens of thousands of them are out there now. Shields are just starting to ship out too. We&#39;ve got a whole bunch of stuff being manufactured in China, getting out the door, and lots of new people joining the community. A lot of people who have been using Cores are now transitioning over to Photon, which is great, super exciting. A lot of new people are showing up that are just getting started with Photon, it&#39;s their first interaction with Particle. That&#39;s fun. That&#39;s all happening, that&#39;s great. Photon is a big step forward for us.</p>

<p>The second thing is the Electron is in development. The Electron is our cellular platform. It launched on Kickstarter a couple of months ago. We&#39;re shipping in October, 2G and 3G for everything. That&#39;s deep in development now. We&#39;re getting really close to finalizing hardware. We&#39;ve already ordered a lot of components and we&#39;ll be doing a beta pretty soon in August. That&#39;s happening in parallel.
We&#39;re also doing really cool things. We&#39;re just getting some people started using our Fleet Management tools to oversee larger fleets of devices they are running on our platform. That&#39;s just starting to happen. Our private beta, just started with that yesterday. A lot of things all happening at once. So, that&#39;s some of the big important things happening at Particle right now.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Sounds pretty fun.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, we&#39;re busy.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I like my pretended ignorance that all this going on by the way. I&#39;m excited for the second half of the interview when other people are going to ask questions.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Are you done Hunter, you want to go down? All right.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I&#39;ve seen a lot of people on Twitter and on the forums engaging and making really cool things with Photon, and a couple of people who are getting stuck, as always happens when you ship a new thing. A lot of people are asking about some timelines for updates for the Photon, when are they going to see the new firmware. What&#39;s in the works?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   The Photon is very young as a product and I think it&#39;s a really important step forward for us because it&#39;s a better hardware architecture. There is a lot we&#39;ve done on the software side to create a compatibility layer. What we want to be able to do is pick up on the hardware as we go—adopt new hardware solutions and have our software work the same all throughout. That is the goal.</p>

<p>The challenge is that the Core doesn&#39;t currently run what we call the Hardware Abstraction Layer, the HAL. We have to do this, hopefully one time thing, of transitioning people off. Most of the code run is the same. The core code is there. The libraries work a little bit differently. We&#39;re working through some of that now. For anyone is bumping into this stuff, like, “This works on the Core, this doesn’t work on the Photon,” we&#39;re working through that. Definitely our apologies that you are getting stuck.</p>

<p>One of the things that we&#39;re also trying to do is start to get to a regular schedule of releasing firmware regularly. We do two week sprints, so hopefully, what we get to is: every sprint we can start to release some firmware. But in order to do that we also want to let people pick firmware versions so that they don&#39;t have to follow along with the development. They can lock something down if they want to. There is a bunch of stuff happening in parallel to make the whole experience a lot better. </p>

<p>The big thing is that next week we&#39;ll be releasing a major firmware update: Version 0.4.3. Right now a lot of people are running 0.4.0, which is what the first Photon when out with. There is a lot of bug fixes that will come out next week. Along with that is a major refresh in documentation. We&#39;ve rebuilt the docs from scratch. Christine actually did a lot of that. Do you want to feign ignorance on that too? Should I interview you?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Maybe that will be next week. [Laughs]</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, so, that will help document a lot of the differences and some of the new stuff that&#39;s happening with the Fleet Management tools.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Great, very cool. I know that one of the things that I have seen a lot as well is people asking how the Photon is different from the Core and if we&#39;re not going to support the Core anymore. They are worried about the End-of-Life-ing of the Core.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   That&#39;s a good question. I mean the Core is definitely something we want to keep supporting. A big part of what I just described is that we implemented this Hardware Abstraction Layer. We will soon be bringing the Core up to the HAL. It&#39;ll be running the same software stack with some modifications to the hardware, but it&#39;ll be up to what&#39;s running on the Photon. Then, we can get to this point where the Core, the Photon, the Electron, whatever comes next, are all running variations on the same version of software. Then, when we make improvements it happens to all of our hardware, all at the same time.</p>

<p>I think this is something that we take for granted when we&#39;re working with products that have operating systems. That the OS— whether you&#39;re running Windows or Mac or Linux— gives you this hardware compatibility layer that lets you run the same operating system on all these different bits of hardware. When you are working with microcontrollers and embedded systems, you don&#39;t typically get that. This HAL will go a long way to doing that, but the Core is definitely coming along for the ride. We have to do some work to catch the Core up. That&#39;s happening right now.</p>

<p>The Core is out of stock, and we are not planning on manufacturing anymore. A big part of the reason is if the Photon is designed to be a complete sort of improvement on the Core in every way, it&#39;s cheaper, faster, better. We wouldn&#39;t typically stop manufacturing of product within that time frame. I think the Core we were selling for a total of about 2 years. You might look and say well, 2 years isn&#39;t that short. I think that in the long-term, we definitely planned on extending, or continuing to manufacture our products longer. </p>

<p>If you look at Arduino’s development, you get a great example of this, the original Arduino I think it was called, my Italian is terrible, duemilanove. It had a long name and it&#39;s not really around anymore because the Uno came out. The Uno came out and became sort of like the Arduino forever. I see the Photon as being that. It&#39;s a big step forward for us and something that we feel we have a lot more control over the experience of. We think it is great and we can make it even better. We plan on supporting the Photon for a longer period of time.</p>

<p>We will keep making hardware iterations, but we will continue to support our hardware. Of course, the software will come along with all of this. The Core is not being left behind.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Cool. There is also a blog post about the Photon and how it&#39;s different from the Core, for people who are wondering. We&#39;re hoping that we might release another blog post that has maybe even more details and maybe a video for people who might want to upgrade and swap out their Cores for Photons.
What do you see about maybe the next 6 months to a year?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Sure. I think about what&#39;s kind of happening with us right now, and some of how our business is changing. I think that what we&#39;re seeing right now with the Photon versus the Core is, I definitely see a lot more people who are starting to think about using the Photon in a production environment than were using the Core. For us, as a business, that&#39;s an important step forward. We really want to support people who are going to scale. We don&#39;t want it to just be a development tool. We want it to be the beginning of scaling. But it doesn&#39;t have to be. It&#39;s not to say if you are just prototyping, or just building a project for yourself that it wouldn&#39;t be a great platform. </p>

<p>I want the Particle community to look like, the community for something like, what&#39;s a good example? Ruby on Rails and NodeJS. Rails and Node are professional tools. They are used in production all the time. The major web programming languages and the frameworks around them are used by professionals all the time, but if you&#39;re making a weekend project they&#39;re there for you in exactly the same way. I see that happening with the Photon. That affects our business in ways we&#39;re just starting to learn. We have people moving into production and there is a lot of questions about, “How do I do X on the manufacturing line?” And we kind of knew how to do that, but we forgot to write it down. We&#39;re documenting a bunch of stuff that we didn&#39;t even realize that people were going to bump into. There is a whole bunch of new documentation stuff we have to make.</p>

<p>There are new problems that we&#39;re tackling, things that happen when you ship a product at scale. With Fleet Management, you can do over the air firmware updates, that&#39;s always been a part of our product, but now if you have a thousand things that are all running the same firmware, you can hit a button and update them all to new versions of software. That&#39;s really cool and really different. It&#39;s a really interesting opportunity. It could change how products get shipped. It also means we have to build a whole bunch of stuff to support it and support it so that anyone from a weekend hobbyist to a professional will be able to use it. That&#39;s a really important step forward for us.</p>

<p>I think the Electron is huge because—and I&#39;d be really curious to get peoples opinions on this out in the world—when I think about the Photon and the Core, versus the alternatives, the Core wasn&#39;t the only thing out there that did what it did. It was better, I think, then a lot of the alternatives. It was more affordable. It was easier to use. It was open source, whereas a lot of the others were proprietary. It wasn&#39;t the only thing out there. There were alternatives and so you had choice.</p>

<p>With the Electron it&#39;s different. There is nothing else out there. If you want a cellular solution and you&#39;re not a big company-- or even if you are a big company and you want something that you don&#39;t have to go negotiate with a carrier for and you don&#39;t just want to go buy a SIM card from the T-Mobile store around the corner-- there are really no good alternatives to the Electron. It opens up a whole new area of products. The customers that are starting to come to us about the Electron are in some ways similar to the Photon. It&#39;s a lot of people are the same people from the community, but we&#39;re also dealing with more industrial customers. </p>

<p>Wi-Fi is typically consumer products. People are building smart home stuff and that kind of thing. With the Electron, it&#39;s a lot more industrial, agriculture, municipal, oil and gas, mining, smart energy, smart-grid and all this stuff that is really interesting for us as a business. It’s also very new to us. It&#39;s a new area for us, and our customers are the same-- it&#39;s engineers and people building products-- but then the end consumer is a little different. I think that&#39;s really exciting. I think there are really cool opportunities in the industrial space and I’m really excited to support that. When we think about our product map into 2016, we want to try and solve more problems for industrial customers. When I say industrial I mean the broadest sense of non-consumer stuff.</p>

<p>That&#39;s cool and pulling us in a totally different direction. So that brings us to early 2016. I think we&#39;ve got our hands full with the stuff we&#39;re already working on. The Photon just getting out there now. We&#39;re going to spend a couple months reeving up the software and getting all the features in their that everybody needs. Getting all the libraries working and putting the Photon into place where it&#39;s really ready for prime time. When the Electron comes out, we&#39;ll be doing the same thing for the Electron. </p>

<p>Inevitably, we will be figuring out all sorts of things about how cellular networks work around the world, because it works in a hundred countries. We&#39;ll spend October through the end of the year figuring out a lot of that. I think then early 2016, is when I think we&#39;ll be in this place where the Photon and Electron are both fully baked and a lot of people are using them. We will understand how people are using them and what products they’re building with them. </p>

<p>Then, we&#39;ll start to think about what the future looks for us. We have some ideas about where we want to go next, but it&#39;s still pretty hazy at this point. Right now we&#39;re just focused on getting these products out and delivering on the promises that we started with.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  A lot of people who ordered Photons-- and many of them have their Photons now-- may have also ordered Electrons. I also know that some people are wondering, “Well Photon was kind of late, is the Electron also going to be late?”</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   We gave ourselves more time with the Electron. So far, we&#39;re sticking to our timelines. I think that&#39;s really exciting. After the Spark Core campaign, and I think for the Photon, a couple of months after the announcement we already had to announce a delay. We haven&#39;t yet for the Electron. We&#39;re still on track for October. That feels really good. I think if you talk to Will, who runs hardware and manufacturing for us, he feels like the progress on the Electron shows that we&#39;re growing up a little bit. It&#39;s a little bit more systematic. We have a better understanding of how long things take. We gave ourselves enough time. </p>

<p>There are some software complexities that we haven&#39;t really dug out yet. We&#39;re still working on carrier integration. There is a lot of stuff about managing the SIM cards and accurately tracking data that we&#39;re hoping will just work when we start to deal with the carriers, but it&#39;s possible that we might find some dragons there. When I think about what&#39;s spooky for me in terms of what might create delays, it&#39;s a lot of this stuff on cellular that&#39;s kind of new and weird that we haven&#39;t totally explored yet. </p>

<p>There is some uncertainty there. There always is; new product development always has a lot of uncertainty there. But I am happy with where we are now compared to October. We have no reason to believe we&#39;re going to get delayed yet. I think that our development process has gotten a lot more rigorous and clear-cut. We&#39;re growing up. We&#39;re becoming a real company.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Capital R, capital C, real company.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yep.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Did you want to maybe talk a little bit about Fleet Management? I&#39;m not sure that everybody out there in the nebulous possibly-one-person-possibly-more audience knows what Fleet Management is.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Oh sure, yeah. Fleet Management, we&#39;ve had this idea for a while and it&#39;s now starting to come to fruition. Let’s say I&#39;m creating a product. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m creating a Wi-Fi connected toaster, because we all know that our toasters really need to have Wi-Fi in them.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  So that you can print on toast.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   So that you can print on toast. Still waiting for somebody to figure that out. </p>

<p>Okay, so here&#39;s my product. It&#39;s a Wi-Fi connected toaster and every morning when I make toast it prints today&#39;s weather forecast. It burns today&#39;s weather forecast into the side of the toast. Great. Cool product. As I&#39;m developing my product and use a Photon or a Core, or an Electron (in this case probably a Photon), I&#39;ll design the circuit around that. The Photon will connect to the relay, the relay will connect to the circuit that heats the toast. I&#39;ll use all of the Particle development tools to write all the software and deploy it over the air, that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Now, I move from one toaster-- we&#39;re going to call it Toasteriffic, because that&#39;s a good name for a Wi-Fi toasting brand. Is there a thing already called Toasteriffic? Would somebody trademark check for me?</p>

<p>Toasteriffic. I made my first prototype and now I&#39;m making 10. Now I make 100, and then 1,000 and then 10,000. What do I need? What are the problems I&#39;m going to run into?</p>

<p>There is some stuff on the manufacturing side. I need to find a contract manufacturer. I need to optimize my build materials and create a custom circuit board and manufacturing plan, and all that. Put that aside for sec.</p>

<p>What do I need on the software side? I need a lot of the same tools that I have with Particle. I want that API. I want to be able to interface with a product through the Particle cloud. But, I also want things to work in a bit of a different way. I have a group now. I have, what I sometimes call a homogeneous group. It&#39;s sort of an army of toasters. My product, when it&#39;s an internet of things product, is not just a single device. It&#39;s a fleet of devices.</p>

<p>Fleet is kind of a funny word. When you talk about fleet people either think about military or they think of trucks. “Fleet Management”-- you think, I&#39;ve got a map of all my 18-wheelers around the country and they are all driving around. I can see their dots and where they are. It&#39;s kind of the same concept, but applied to toasters. I can theoretically have a map of all my toasters and who&#39;s using them and what they’re doing right now. Are they toasting? Are they not toasting? Are they online? Are they offline? Did one of them explode? All of that. Hopefully their not exploding. I could have all that information available to me. </p>

<p>Then I need a tool, as the product creator or product manager of the toaster. (Toasteriffic, trademark.) I need a place where I can log in and see what&#39;s happening with the toasters. Is there a problem? Can I fix the problem? That&#39;s Fleet Management. What we want to do is give people a way to say, here&#39;s all your devices, here&#39;s what&#39;s happening with them. Drill down to an individual device. If someone calls in and says their toaster is not working, I can actually click on their device and see what&#39;s going on, maybe pull some diagnostic information off of it, or try and toast it remotely and see if the toaster is working or not. If a toaster does something wrong, like it tries to heat but it can&#39;t, or it tries to heat and it bursts into giant flames, then I could see that and maybe trigger a message, or something along those lines. Then, when I fix the problem that causes the toaster to go up in flames, by writing a firmware update, I can hit one button and I can distribute it out to the entire fleet.</p>

<p>All of that is part of what we call Fleet Management. We just have a private beta that started this week. If you&#39;re interested in participating in the private beta, if you haven&#39;t already, you can go to dashboard.particle.io and go to the upper right. There is a button, I think it&#39;s “request invite,” to create an organization. You can check that out. As an individual I can use these tools to see all my Cores, Photons, Electrons, whatever. But when I create an organization, now I can see all of my customers’ devices and what they are all up to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a huge step towards the production grade tooling that is now part of our platform and will be released publicly at the end of August.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Hopefully that gives people a sense of what fleet management is. That&#39;s going to be really fun to transcribe later.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Toasteriffic go out and make it if it&#39;s not out already.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I&#39;d like to give a free Electron to anybody that actually makes Toasteriffic.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Toasteriffic.io. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s available.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Cool, what else do we have?
We have new docs, I know that people have questions about that. I don&#39;t know if one can actually do a screen share on a hangout, but I was wondering if maybe you wanted to show people what that looks like?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   For sure.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Let me check to see what I can do.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Hey, people are talking. We should ask them.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  So many people are talking.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Let&#39;s see if people are saying anything we can address.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Okay, let&#39;s see.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Hold on, we&#39;re reading your comments so give us a sec to see.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Somebody noticed the fireplace-</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, there&#39;s a fireplace. That&#39;s good.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  That&#39;s good.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   People are just chatting with each other. You guys are all making friends in there. That&#39;s fun, that&#39;s fun. David said it, Arduino 2009, duemillenove. Something like that. Anyway, all right thanks David.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  All right.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Okay. Now, let&#39;s talk about documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Do you want to do a little demo?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, I&#39;m going to do a little demo. Okay, we redid our docs. We&#39;ll be publishing this next week. It is super exciting. There is a lot of really cool stuff in here. For us, documentation is a really important part of the experience because it&#39;s what allows you to get started. If you&#39;re working with either straight up normal unconnected hardware or even connected to hardware, there are things that are challenging for a newcomer to grasp, such as datasheets. We&#39;re trying to create a really nice onboarding process here, and we&#39;ve made some really nice improvements.</p>

<p>One of the things that we&#39;ve done is: we now have sections. Previously there was one massive place where you go for all of the content. That was nice in that you knew where to go for all that stuff, but the downside is as the quantity of content grew, it outgrew the navigation. We now have different sections. We have a guide, which is where you will show up if you go to it the first time. We have reference, which is the firmware documentation and the API documentation. It&#39;s where you can go if you&#39;re writing something you need to look-up, like a function call.</p>

<p>You have datasheets. These are hardware datasheets. The nicest datasheets I have ever seen. Thanks to Brett for those.</p>

<p>And then support which is just general troubleshooting. Some of the things relate to placing an order on our website. Some of it relates to troubleshooting of the platform.</p>

<p>Okay, great we have these sections. This allows us to create a bunch of new content. We can put more stuff in here without it all getting lost. We also have a search bar which is super nice. You say I want to learn about listening, if I just type in “listening,” you can see that I get a bunch of results that relate to different platforms. It tells me where I can go, and I can click on these and end up in different parts of the documentation. Searchable docs, super nice.</p>

<p>Also, I might be using the Core, I might be using the Photon. In the future I might be using the Electron. The documentation might be a little bit different, because they do work a little bit differently. I can pick what device I&#39;m running and the docs will remember this. I can then make sure that I&#39;m reading the correct documentation for the correct product.</p>

<p>Now the guide, we&#39;ve changed how it&#39;s laid out. It&#39;s a lot more linear; it&#39;s more of a story. You can start at the beginning of the guide and read through chapter by chapter, leveling up as you go. You can see that I can actually move onto the next page and this is more a long form written out, here&#39;s what I do, step-by-step. It kind of fits with the flow that you expect of a guide. Also, as I scroll I can see where I am at the left, and the navigation unfolds. It&#39;s much easier to figure out where you are in this massive content. That&#39;s all really nice. We have a Getting Started section, and Tools and Features (which walks through all the major tools that are part of the Particle platform).</p>

<p>Then we have a whole new section called How to Build A Product. We&#39;re trying our best with this to describe every single thing that you need to think about in the transition from prototype to production. It goes from hardware-- so what are the things you need to keep in mind in the design of your hardware-- to what are the hardware design requirements for our platform, how do you use the dashboard that we just talked about (the Fleet Management tools). How do you build your web app for your product? How do you build a mobile app for your product using our mobile SDKs for iOS and Android? How do you manufacture, program, and test your devices on manufacturing line? How do you also order large volume hardware from us? Then things to think about as you scale. </p>

<p>This is awesome for us, because we field a lot of questions about “How do I do X?” This is the first time we&#39;ve actually sat down and written out the entire process. Here are all the things you need to know about how to build a product. Since I&#39;m screensharing, you probably can&#39;t see that I&#39;m gesticulating wildly as I talk through this. All this stuff is great.</p>

<p>Then, of course as before, I can hit edit and can actually contribute back to the documentation by creating a pull request on the documentation. That&#39;s super, super cool. This is going to go out publicly next week. You should get excited. It&#39;ll change how you interact with our documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  We are just about at 4:30. I told myself that I was going to reserve the last half hour for questions. I know that I didn&#39;t get down my entire list, but I&#39;m sure that some of the wonderful people that are listening will be able to write in any questions that they think might need to be answered at this point. </p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Write in your questions if you&#39;ve got some. While you do that, and Christine reads the questions, I will see if I can get Hunter to do a dance for you. Hunter, come here buddy. Come here. Okay, he&#39;s not very interested in doing a dance. All right, well I&#39;m going to entertain you while Christine looks for questions and talk about random things.</p>

<p>We&#39;re in Particle house right now. We&#39;re in San Francisco in The Mission. It&#39;s warm because we don&#39;t have air conditioning, which is mostly okay except right now when it&#39;s super, super hot. We have a fire, which is probably contributing to the problem, although it is on an iPad. It&#39;s not that warm of a fire. You may have noticed that sometimes it has captions, and sometimes it says “crackling” in brackets. It is making sound.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I really think that hearing-- and if not hearing that reading-- the fire is a really big part of the experience.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, yeah, exactly. It is crackling wherever it may be. All right I&#39;m out of things to say. Do you have any questions from the world out there?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Can you tell us about some of the non Particle produced hardware running the Particle platform, such as Bluz, Oak etc.?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, sure. This is a cool new thing. We are not no longer the only company that makes hardware that runs on our platform. This was something that we kind of hoped and envisioned for a while. I&#39;ll tell a little bit of a story. It started with Eric from Bluz. Previous to Bluz, he was creating a product called GoGlove. GoGlove is a glove that is Bluetooth connected. He reached out to us just for his own product. Many of you may have followed this thread on the forums. He wanted to essentially extend the Particle platform, because he liked all of our tools and the cloud, and he wanted to extend it into Bluetooth products. He ported over our stack for GoGlove. </p>

<p>When he did he thought this was kind of cool, what if I created a development kit for this? So he did, and called it Bluz. At some point he contacted us and was like, “How do I do this guys?” We were like oh, that&#39;s really interesting. We&#39;d love to see Bluetooth on our platform. How do you do it? Go ahead and we&#39;ll support you. We didn&#39;t really know. We didn&#39;t have a model figured out for it at that point. We just basically said yes, we&#39;re super supportive, we&#39;ll do whatever we can to help. He went ahead and he built it. He had a Kickstarter campaign and was successful. He&#39;s now deep in production. I think he&#39;s shipping in October. That&#39;s super cool.</p>

<p>After that, probably I guess it&#39;s probably a couple of months later many of you may have seen Oak launch on Kickstarter. Oak is a new Wi-Fi development kit from a company called Digistump. Digistump made the Digispark and they&#39;ve made a bunch of great development tools. They have great community. Erik-- also named Eric, there is 2 Eric&#39;s-- Erik with a K created Oak. He liked our API and decided that he was going to create a Spark compatible API, so that you could run software that could run against our API or his API, and basically was like, “Well these are good ideas here, so let&#39;s implement them together and follow the same paradigms.” And we said, this is great. Thank you for liking this stuff, and we love what you’re up to. Is there anyway that we can be helping you more? Can we actually host your cloud? Or would you be interested in running your stuff on our cloud?</p>

<p>We talked about it. We had a good conversation about what his business goals were and worked out a model that made sense for him and for us. He, at the end of the day, was like “Okay, yeah, let&#39;s do it, let&#39;s run on the same platform.” I think both of us are really excited because the Oak runs on the ESP8266, which is a chip that&#39;s getting a lot of traction coming out of a Chinese company called Espressif, which is a cool new chip. For us, we were excited about the Broadcom chip that&#39;s in the Photon because it&#39;s battle-tested now. It&#39;s been on the market for awhile. It is the product that is in most of the consumer products out there. Nest Protect, LIFX, Amazon Dash, Honeywell thermostats, and more. We were really excited about taking something that&#39;s battle-tested. Especially as our customers get a little bit more professional, that&#39;s great.</p>

<p>The ESP8266 is exciting for a different set of reasons. It&#39;s really cheap. It&#39;s got huge community growing around it. It&#39;s kind of a leading-edge thing. That&#39;s super cool. By Erik supporting it through Digistump and Oak, but working together on a cloud platform, it means that we can have a variety of hardware solutions. If you want the Broadcom solution we can provide that to you directly. If you want a ESP8266, then Erik and Oak have that. We hope to see this to continue to expand into different chips, different wireless protocols. Essentially, we are very open to supporting other companies that want to build hardware and don&#39;t want to deal with the cloud. </p>

<p>If you look like that, let us know. We&#39;d love to chat. I think it&#39;s one of the interesting ways that we will see our community grow, it’s not just the hardware we produce, but hardware that our partners produce. Yeah, that&#39;s happening it&#39;s super cool. We call them Compounds because we&#39;re now called Particle and we try to make as many puns related to the name as we can. Such as this Particle Interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Particle Interactions. That was actually Peekay123&#39;s suggestion.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Oh yeah? Thanks Paul.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Yeah, my original thought was Particle Dynamics, but I like Particle Interactions a lot better.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   That&#39;s good. Between Two Atoms. No? Anyone?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  We have two plants in the office. They&#39;re sort of fern like.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   They&#39;re very fern like.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  We could have put one there and one there and had Particle Interactions between two ferns. </p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   A different vibe.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  We have people wondering if Core will still be in prod since they need it for existing product support, and are not intending to switch to Photons for now.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   If Cores will still be in production?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   We don&#39;t have currently have plans to manufacture any more Cores. If you need Cores, especially if you need them in quantity, let us know immediately. We do have some still floating around, a small number. There are some in Maker Kits. Right now if you go on our website, the Core is sold out. There are Maker Kits available. We can help people out in smaller quantities, we can scrunch them together. There are also some in retailers. Some of our distribution partners still have Cores. We can help people get a hold of them. If you need larger quantities we can work with you to figure out the right way to make that happen. We want to make sure we can help people move forward with whatever it is they&#39;re working on. If you&#39;re in that position, basically just come talk to us. You can either email hello@particle.io or you can email or sales team and Dan, our Head of Sales, would be happy to help you work through that. That is sales@particle.io. Yeah, we&#39;d love to see if we can help.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Cool. One question was why don&#39;t you change from fireplace for your home to ice place for your home? I just did a search for that on Netflix and unfortunately, it does not exist.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Ice places. This is the next connected device. We have a Wi-Fi connected ice place. I think that just means that you have an icebox and you just open it. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  It&#39;s like a refrigerator for your home.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, exactly. You just put refrigerator here and you open it, or an air conditioner I suppose would solve a similar problem. Air conditioner would be a great idea.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Another person is asking will I one day be able to update my Photon through the online IDE?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yes. Today, is that day! Where you can update the Photon through the online IDE. The IDE works with the Photon right now. Next week, we&#39;ll be pushing out a new firmware version, auto-updating people to the latest version. That&#39;ll happen soon. I&#39;m guessing the question might relate to the fact that there are some new features and bug fixes that have gone out that people want access to, like, yesterday. </p>

<p>In the short term what we&#39;ve been saying is “Hey, you can do this, you have to compile locally to be able to use the latest versions because we haven&#39;t yet released it to the cloud.” Next week that will change. Next week you&#39;ll be able to get the new stuff in the cloud, and in the meantime if you want to you can do local development. It is a little bit more work and not our happy path, clean process. But it&#39;s there. It&#39;s an open-source platform you can always explore those firmware releases that are still in development.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  We have a question that&#39;s asking: What are the limits of the Electron, SMS versus MMS capability, can one build a cellphone with Particle Electron?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Theoretically, yes. In reality, there are some limitations, because for us-- this is something we debated when we released the Photon-- How much do we want to see if people access to? It&#39;s an open source platform, so at a high-level you can do whatever you want. The next question is what do we support as a direct thing. A big part of the Electron is it&#39;s hardware. It also comes with a SIM card and a data plan. </p>

<p>When we went out to get data plans from carriers, what we found is data is affordable. Text messages were super expensive. The way that these companies charge for text messages was what they call M to M plans, which is machine to machine. What they refer to as the cellular internet of things. Pricing looks like 1997 text message pricing. It&#39;s kind of absurd when you look at it. So, our preferred solution if you want to send a text message would be to send a data message and then send a webhook to Twilio and use Twilio to send a text message. That&#39;s something we hope to at some point adopt as a first-class citizen where we can actually provide a text message support through Twilio as a feature of the platform. In the meantime, it is totally possible to send a text message by using something like Twilio.</p>

<p>As for phone calls, the hardware connections to make a phone call are not exposed on the Electron. Part of the reason for that is that it&#39;s a really tiny board and there wasn&#39;t very much room. To make it as small, as close to the size of the Photon as we could, we had to make some sacrifices one of them was voice, because it&#39;s not really a feature that we want to primarily support. If you can hack it to do it, that&#39;d be super cool, I&#39;d love to see somebody do it. It&#39;s also from a certification perspective we will be pursuing certification as a data platform, but not for voice because it makes the regulations significantly more challenging. </p>

<p>You have to deal with things, like if it&#39;s a voice product, you have to get it regulated to be near your face. The rules for this stuff is crazy. I mean it&#39;s not that crazy. There’s radiation, if you&#39;re supposed to put it right here. The powers-that-be have different expectations for the radiation than if it&#39;s out here. We&#39;re designing it for use cases that are out here and not next to your face, but it is still a development kit and it is hackable. Do whatever you want with it. It&#39;s not going to melt your brain, it&#39;s just that we&#39;re not pursuing a certification. We&#39;re not going to spend the money to certify it for that.</p>

<p>All that is to say, open-source, do what you want. Hack it. Have fun. Explore whatever you can. The things that we will be supporting are data and data only. We will definitely pursue ways that we can make it really easy to do other cool stuff using the data levels.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I have a couple of other Electron questions here. How secure is the communication on the cellular networks with the Electron, and how hard would it be if someone wanted to intercept some code being sent to the Electron?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Good question. Secure and hard. Our protocol is encrypted. We encrypt all the communication from the device to the cloud. In addition, the cellular networks themselves are also encrypted. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to basically intercept a message in a cellular network at all, just by design of the cellular network.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s not something I&#39;m a very deep expert in, so I don&#39;t know a lot of the details, but I know that network is encrypted, but that we don&#39;t just rely on encryption. We add our own layer, which is the same encryption that is on Photon and the Core. All those communications are secured. You can open up a TCP socket to another service. At that point, it&#39;s up to you to secure those communications. As long as you are sending a message to our cloud we handle all the encryption, and you’re more than welcome to send messages to other places as well. At that point, implementing an additional security layer is kind of on you.</p>

<p>In general, I think the overall statement is: as long as you&#39;re using the tools that we provide, security is taken care of and you don&#39;t have to worry about. That is also true for over the air firmware updates because I know that&#39;s important, that&#39;s one of the most important reasons that this stuff has to be secured.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  The last question about the Electron that I saw was: will I get access to a baseband radio on the Electron?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   No. Now, that&#39;s not us. Open-source, we love to open-source whatever we can. The baseband radio is within the module, which is a U-blox module. As far as I&#39;m aware, they do not provide access at that level until they give you an AT commands interface, which we&#39;ll use to communicate with the towers. That&#39;s the level of access that they provide. I know that might feel like, “I really want access! I really want to have full control of everything.” The reality of open-source hardware is that all of our open-source hardware is built on some proprietary layers by other companies. We have to accept what we&#39;re given.</p>

<p>There has been some really interesting work. Any of you out there familiar with Bunnie Huang, he is one of our advisors. He&#39;s done some really cool work, reverse engineering the base bands on a MediaTek chip, which is super cool. We had some conversations back when we were developing Electron about actually using the work that he was doing in the Electron. He was like, “This is super experimental. It maybe quite sometime before we&#39;re ready to use it in production.” I&#39;m really curious to see where that goes. I&#39;d love to see more open source stuff in this area. </p>

<p>One of the challenges that we have to balance is we want to be as open as we can be, but also comply with regulations because we&#39;re basically going to be putting a lot of devices on these towers. As far as I&#39;m aware, this will be the first time that there is a mass-produced development kit being sold in the quantity, in the short period of time, and with data service, that we&#39;re doing. Development kits can typically get around regulations because they&#39;re being used by professionals. You&#39;re not doing it en masse. But when we ship ten thousand of them the rules change a little bit. We have to make sure that we comply with the rules and regulations so that the carriers are cool with what we&#39;re doing because we do use their towers and the certification bodies-- FCC, CE, IC, PTCRB-- everyone is sort of happy with the way things work. That is something that we have to factor in to the way we do things. Given that, we try to be as open as we can within the constraints that are out in the world.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Are we expecting any cool new shields made specifically for Particle?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yes. You may have seen SparkFun has now adopted Particle, the Photon, into their ecosystem. They have a bunch of shields for the Photon. That is super cool! Go to sparkfun.com and check it out. Those will be available for sale soon. We are super excited about SparkFun and SparkFun is super excited about us. We will be continuing to work with them. I expect, I hope and expect to see them developing more shields for the Electron too. Adafruit also has a neopixel kit that they have developed. We should see that out in the world pretty soon. Seeed Studio has a Grove Kit. So, that&#39;s kind of like, “best hits.” Everybody has got their best thing on the Particle platform right now. </p>

<p>We definitely want to see more. We&#39;ll be exploring this with all the people out there that make shields. If you want to make shields we&#39;d love to help. We&#39;d love to see more good community-developed stuff along these lines. We will keep making shields for all the things that we think are most broadly useful. There is a lot of shields that we won&#39;t make and we&#39;d love to see you create them and support you in doing so. We have a program for doing that. If you&#39;re interested contact us again, hello@particle.io and we&#39;d love to chat with you about that.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  As a side note, I was browsing the community the other day and I noticed we actually have a community member was actually building a shield called the Q-Shield, it is a quadcopter shield.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   It is super awesome. I&#39;m really happy about it because I once said that I was going to build something like that and then I totally failed.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I was about to bring that up. I think now it would actually be really, really easy for you to build yours, just pop it in.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   I&#39;m a huge supporter of Q-Shield because they made my failure less bad. I&#39;m really busy guys so I never got around to making Charm which is my Photon-</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  What does Charm stand for?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   It doesn&#39;t stand for anything. Charm is a kind of quark. Particles, right? Got to use all the names. My idea was that I first wanted to create a quadcopter and name it Charm. Then, make a hexapod and name it Strange. Those of you out there who know the 6 types of quarks, are Up, Down-- crap, somebody write me what they are. Up, Down, Strange, Charm, and then there are two more. I want to say Left Right, but I&#39;m pretty sure that Left and Right are not names of quarks. Since Strange quark and Charm quark are 2 kinds of quarks, I thought that Charm would be a great name. Can you imagine, it would be a quadcopter and it would have a smiley face and be really cute and called Charm. Then, you make a hexapod with an ugly face and teeth, you name it Strange. They would be a really nice little pair of robots that fly around.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  They could be friends.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Or walk around, they could be friends. That&#39;s what I had envisioned. I got as far as the vision statement then I got pulled into other things. It&#39;s still in my backlog. I haven&#39;t made much progress. I&#39;m really excited about Q-Shield. I would love to follow the people who are eagerly awaiting Charm. Hopefully other quadcopters that will be coming out on the Photon platform in the future. </p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  One question: does Particle plan to continue the development of the Spark server.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Yeah, Spark server is definitely still in development. Right now you can do some of the things on the Photon and some you can&#39;t. Mostly because the team that&#39;s working on Spark server also works on the other tools. A lot of the other tools, like the CLI, have been going through some major improvements to make sure it works with the Photon as well as the Core. We just haven&#39;t gotten to the Spark server yet. That&#39;s not to say that we&#39;re not supporting it. It&#39;s just mostly a lot of the pressure, the people that we need the most to get that going have been focused on the other tools. We&#39;ve worked on those first. We will be getting to the Spark server and updating it, so the full set of features that are available on the Photon work. </p>

<p>Also, probably at some point we&#39;ll probably change them from Spark server to Particle server, which is just one of the things, you may see we&#39;re still Spark, because we didn&#39;t want to break all the dependencies from all the naming of things. We will at some point make that change from Spark to Particle. We haven&#39;t quite gotten there yet.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  One question I think is pretty good: With release of the thread standard will we ever see any low power mesh products from Particle?</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   It&#39;s definitely something we&#39;re thinking a lot about. I think it&#39;s super cool. Thread is really interesting. I&#39;ll give my perspective on the whole low power mesh side. ZigBee and Z-Wave have never really took off the way they were supposed to. They&#39;re kind of the home automation protocols. ZigBee got closest. It doesn&#39;t feel like it got widespread consumer adoption. </p>

<p>I think a big part of that is that protocol to be successful, especially in a consumer context is not just about having a good protocol it&#39;s also about building a great brand. This is something that Wi-Fi-- the Wi-Fi Alliance, I forget the name of the Bluetooth group, it might be the Bluetooth Alliance-- have kind of figured out Wi-Fi is a brand and also Bluetooth. Bluetooth in particular is a really strong brand these days.</p>

<p>If you look at BLE for instance, BLE is a very different protocol from Bluetooth. In fact, there is a lot more similar I think to ANT, which is not as widely used, but has a lot of the same characteristics of BLE. I sort of look at BLE, and I don&#39;t know the real history behind this, but it sort of feels like Bluetooth looked at ANT and was like, “That&#39;s a good idea. We&#39;re going to take parts of that and build BLE.” You can imagine if the same thing had been true for ZigBee, like if Wi-Fi Alliance had looked at ZigBee and said, “That&#39;s cool. We&#39;re going to use that, or something like it and call it Wi-Fi low power, or Wi-Fi low energy or something like that.” It probably would have taken off. I think there actually is a Wi-Fi spec like 80211.AH, I think is a low power thing, but I don&#39;t know how far along it&#39;s gotten.</p>

<p>Thread is great because, the guys behind thread, it’s a mix, it&#39;s nest, 3scale, Samsung, I think they have really strong technical confidence with a really good understanding of brand. I think that thread has the capability of being super successful in the context of the home if they pull everything off. </p>

<p>All that is to say, what about non-home solutions? I get a lot of questions about what do you think of Thread in an industrial setting, or agriculture or something like that. I think what I&#39;ve seen is if you talk to the Thread team about this, they say, “Super cool. Sounds interesting. We&#39;re really focused on the home right now.” With this general “maybe we&#39;ll get to that one day” kind of thing. The spec, the protocol, there is nothing that necessarily excludes you from using it for a non-consumer context, but the Thread group is very focused on winning the home with Thread. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really interested in low power mesh in a lot of cases for the non-home application. I&#39;d love to see more low power mesh in cities, in farms. Some of its there. Then, the question is, is Thread applicable in those cases? This is an area where we are starting to think really heavily about what our solution there might look like. It&#39;s something I&#39;m really interested in exploring more deeply. Is Thread the right solution or not, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be the first people to adopt a new protocol.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re going to do a Thread thing, we&#39;d probably want to see Thread get some pretty strong traction around it and then have customers come to us and say we need Thread. Then at that point say, yeah, okay, we&#39;ll build a Thread. Otherwise, if we do go down that path we may choose to use some of the protocols that are more established that have been around for a little while, like and it might just be something like 6lowpan. Something along those lines. We are exploring the protocols, the standards that are coming out. We&#39;re keeping our eye out on it. It is something that we think is very exciting. We&#39;d love to figure out how we can participate and how we can best support our customers in creating products that fit into that world of low power mesh.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Nice.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   You guys ask these really short questions, and I give these really long answers. I hope that&#39;s all right. I&#39;m a talker.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  All right let&#39;s see. We are pretty much close to the end I think. I&#39;m looking to see if there are any questions that are really short-answer. I think probably none of these are probably two minute questions. I&#39;m going to close this one on out. Thank you very much Zach for taking the time.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   Thank you Christine for inviting me into the conference room and setting all of this up, especially the fire-</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  I thought the fire was a nice touch.</p>

<p><strong>Zach:</strong>   ... and the pipes.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong>  Okay, cheers. Thank you everybody for joining us, and we&#39;ll be doing another one of these in 2 weeks. I will be posting that on the community. Thanks so much, bye y’all.</p>
