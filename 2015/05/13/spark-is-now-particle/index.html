            <p><em>So which Spark are you, exactly?</em></p>

<p>When I started Spark in 2012... actually, let&#39;s step back further.</p>

<p>The first company I started in 2011 was called Hex Goods. We (well, I) sold designer products (decor, accessories, etc.) online - I imagined it as a curated Etsy.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/hexgoods.jpg"></div>

<p>Two things remain of Hex Goods. First is a single coffee mug with the &#39;Hex Goods&#39; logo on it that my supportive wife bought for me when I launched the site. Second is the corporation Hex Goods, Inc., which became Hex Labs, Inc., and then became Spark Labs, Inc., the corporate name of Spark IO. And now it&#39;s about to change again.</p>

<p>In early 2012, I shut down Hex Goods and started Spark. Actually, I started &quot;Switch Devices&quot;, which was the original name of Spark. Spark started as a connected lighting company, not an Internet of Things platform. I thought &quot;Switch&quot; was a fun name because of its double meaning: a lightswitch, but also a &quot;switch&quot; in perspective for connected products. Unfortunately, some other folks had <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelkanellos/2014/12/02/its-lights-out-for-led-startup-switch/">a thing called Switch</a> (although it looks like they went out of business), so I started looking for a new name.</p>

<p>Spark was one of a handful of names I was considering; the others were Torch and Candle. I picked Spark because I felt like it provided more flexibility going forward, and again I liked the double meaning: this time, a &quot;Spark&quot; of light plus a &quot;Spark&quot; of inspiration. Switch Devices became Spark Devices.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-upgrade-your-lights-with-wi-fi-and-apps">Spark Socket</a> launched on Kickstarter in late 2012, and was unsuccessful. Over the following six months, we pivoted from a consumer IoT product to an IoT platform for engineers and developers. The name Spark still felt appropriate (now it&#39;s a &quot;Spark&quot; of electricity instead of lighting), but we bought a new domain and changed from Spark Devices to Spark IO shortly after our Kickstarter campaign for the Spark Core, because we weren&#39;t really in the business of devices any more.</p>

<p>Spark IO served us well for a while. It was a great brand with strong meaning and lots of positive connotations; it&#39;s short, easy to remember, and easy to pronounce.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, lots of other people feel the same way about Spark.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/allthesparks.png"></div>

<p>If you search &#39;Spark&#39; on the USPTO&#39;s <a href="http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/">Trademark Electronic Search System</a>, you will find 681 live trademarks that include the word Spark. These trademarks are typically not in conflict with one another because each covers a narrow industry, and those narrow industries theoretically don&#39;t overlap. Except when they do.</p>

<p>In our case, there are four Sparks that create confusion for us:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Apache Spark</a>, a popular tool for working with big data</li>
<li>Autodesk&#39;s <a href="http://spark.autodesk.com/">Spark 3D printer platform</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun</a>, one of the top retailers for hobbyist/DIY electronics</li>
<li><a href="http://www.spark.co.nz/">Spark NZ</a>, a cellular carrier in New Zealand.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these Sparks creates confusion in a different way. We frequently get people popping into our IRC channel #spark and asking questions about big data. Autodesk will soon be selling 3D printers to the same customers that we sell IoT development tools to: R&amp;D groups and design firms. SparkFun is an amazing company that we&#39;ve wanted to work with forever but the concern about brand confusion was too great. And now that we&#39;ve got a cellular platform with the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sparkdevices/spark-electron-cellular-dev-kit-with-a-simple-data/">Electron</a>, I&#39;ve been expecting Spark NZ&#39;s lawyers to be calling us any day.</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve grown as a company, the scope of our business is growing, and we&#39;re bumping into more Sparks. So rather than trying to fight it, we&#39;re making a change. As of May 13, 2015, Spark is now Particle.</p>

<p><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/particle.png"></p>

<p>Our new name Particle gives us plenty of room to grow. Once again, we&#39;ve got a double meaning: a &quot;particle&quot; is a single discreet unit within a larger system, just like our dev kits and devices on our platform are single units in a greater whole. It also suggests that we make physical things. We&#39;ve named our new dev kits after elementary particles — Photon and Electron — and we&#39;ll continue that naming scheme as we come out with new products.</p>

<p>Expect to see changes in our platform to reflect the new name over the next few weeks. You can now find us at <a href="http://www.particle.io">www.particle.io</a>, and our API is available at https://api.particle.io (although the old API at api.spark.io will still work for quite some time). We&#39;ll be switching our Facebook/Twitter/Github/IRC/etc. accounts in the next week or two. When changes are to be made in software, we&#39;ll give you plenty of advanced notice, especially when we&#39;re deprecating old things.</p>

<p>Thank you again for all of your support, and thanks for joining us on our journey from tiny start-up to... whatever it is we&#39;ll become next.</p>

<p><em>Zach and the... Particle team</em></p>
