<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yes. Hi, everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Hello.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We’re back here with another Particle Interaction, this time with our wonderful CTO, Dr. Zachary Crockett.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Hello, everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We’re just going to ask some questions about, generally, how life is here at Particle, and we can start with just a sense of what your day-to-day is like as the CTO. What is a CTO?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Okay. Back in 2012 when Zach and I were starting the company, being a CTO meant that I wrote all the code. I wrote all the firmware and I wrote all the cloud code and that was how it was. These days, not so much. I do lots and lots of communication. Particle is a heavily engineering-driven company. Developers have a great deal of autonomy here that just requires us to do a lot of keeping each other on the same page.</p>

<p>I spend my days in meetings, both meeting with external partners and clients, customers but also internal people so checking in with the developers here and seeing how people are doing against their goals for the Sprint, making sure everybody is staying on track, staying focused on providing good value to the users of the system. Let’s see. I don&#39;t know. There are all kinds of things I could talk about but mostly it means I talk to a lot of people, keep everybody on the same track.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That’s a very important job.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> It is.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> And you get a cool title.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> The chief of things. As the Chief Technical Officer-- Chief Technology Officer-- Is it &quot;Technical&quot; or &quot;Technology&quot; in CTO?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I think I always write &quot;Technical.&quot; I’m not actually sure, whatever.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> As the Chief-- let’s call it Technical-- Officer, what do you think the next 6 months are looking like in terms of Particle technology?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Sure. Electron, Electron, Electron. There is so much to do there. We’re so excited. Everybody is diving in head first there. There are tons of things to build. Also the device management dashboard part of which goes with the Electron because people are going to have to have ways to turn on, activate and deactivate their SIM cards and manage their billing, manage their team, manage all those devices that are out in farm fields, or on trucks, or in warehouses. There’s a lot of things that we have to build. There are back end integrations with our career partners. There are billing integrations. There’s lots of stuff in the dashboard. There’s a ton of firmware work because connecting over cellular is very different than connecting with Wi-Fi. It’s all about the Electron.</p>

<p>Generally, other things in the device management dashboard-- supporting product creators. Basically, adding more and more features to firmware and in the cloud and the dashboard and the documentation to make sure that those making products on the platform have everything they need. That when they have a question, the answer is right there. It’s very clear. Hopefully they don’t even have questions, just the flow is super smooth.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That is great.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Last time when Richard was here on Particle Interactions, we talked a little bit about the fleet management dashboard also known as device management, also just generally known as dashboard at times. I was wondering if you wanted to talk a little more about that.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> We talked about it. Let’s see. Yeah. I mean, it’s where we’re focusing a lot right now. When we started, the first web property that mattered in terms of messing with your things was the <a href="http://build.particle.io">Build IDE</a>. You can go there. You can write code. You can see compile errors. We handle the compiling for you because that’s complicated. You can see your list of devices and you can manage libraries, but as we started building up all the tools that product creators need those are... It didn’t seem to live in Build. It didn’t seem the right place.</p>

<p>I mean, we wanted to build this place from scratch. If you have a long list of devices which gets ugly in Build. If you have customers and you need to see links between those devices and customers and you need to do some recording that way and the logs feature that’s in the dashboard, that’s really great. We decided to put that there. There might be some version of that that might belong in Build later. Richard was talking about this <a href="/2015/08/31/particle-interactions-sprint-42/">last time</a>, that serial debugging that you might want to see while you’re in the process of coding.</p>

<p>Of course coming down the line, we have lots of things for the Electron. You’re going to be managing all your SIM cards and your devices. There’s a new concept of ownership with the Electron. A customer can be attached to, not just the device. That’s also true like this customer owns this Electron and call functions on it and everything but also to the SIM card. Imagine if you gave someone the Electron but not the SIM card, or you gave them the SIM card but not the Electron.</p>

<p>This is something we have to manage-- who pays for what usage. That’s some of the things that we have to build into the dashboard. The organization dashboard, the things for product creators, are really important. There is something that we talked about for a long time as being called the product creator workflow. There’s the product creator onboarding process-- when someone creates a product says like, “Yeah. Here’s my organization. I’m going to create a product.”</p>

<p>We have a set of questions that we walk people through that part of which is we need to know the information so we can support the product correctly, make sure the cloud and everything behaves the way it should, make sure customers can do the things that they’re supposed to and not others. Make sure authentication between the servers of the product and our servers do everything they’re supposed to. Also that questionnaire has a serious educational component.</p>

<p>There are lot of pieces of that when you go through it that, at least in the short-term, don’t make any specific difference in how the cloud or anything functions. But what they do to is tell product creators, “Oh, hey. You haven’t thought about authentication. Here are a few options. There are more but here are a few options of how you can do authentication. We’ll walk you through those. Here are things you might have to think about when you are manufacturing these devices. When are they going to get programmed on the line or you want to do it later when the user sets it up?”</p>

<p>There are several other questions that largely have an educational component, and that’s really huge for making sure that the product creators have everything that they need. They have a smooth path from prototype all the way to production. Firmware management. That’s the other awesome thing in the dashboard. If you’re a product creator and haven’t signed up to use the organizational dashboard yet, there are some cool things in there.</p>

<p>Managing firmware releases is pretty awesome-- being able to deploy them to all your devices at the click of a button. Also, the safeguards that we build in there to say you can’t, for instance, flash to all of your products in the field until you have proven to the cloud that it actually works on at least one device. It’s like it won’t let you do it. So yeah, there are some natural things.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That’s good. Yeah. I mean, anything that you can do with that last point to prevent your devices or your customer’s devices from getting large amounts of faulty firmware, the better.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yes. We want to prevent those things from happening even if it might have been an accident on the part of a product creator to the extent that we can save those users from that bad experience. We want to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Excellent. Let’s see what other questions do we have. I think thinking about firmware from a different perspective. We often use &quot;firmware&quot; very loosely: sometimes to speak about the user firmware that individuals flash to their devices, and other times to speak about the system firmware that comes on your Photon when you get it. I know that we have been working on updates to the system firmware. I was wondering if you wanted to talk a little bit about that.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Sure. The Photon is so amazing. My team has created some things-- it’s just mind-blowing. One of the big feats was separating out on the Core-- We had just one big binary. The Core has this much flash, just like zzzzzddddhhht, write the whole thing. There’s your app, cool. No problem. Features like dynamic linking and dynamic loading of libraries are this low level C thing that people typically associate with operating systems like on our computers, on the Linux and Mac machines, on the Windows machines. We have libraries, we have .SLL, and .A, and .DLL files that are like they’re there ready to be used by some of the program. And that’s not a really common thing to have in firmware.</p>

<p>We removed the external flash, going from the Core to the Photon as one of the things to make the board single-sided, so that people can surface mount it, and it’s better for putting in a real product. We got more internal flash, but we lost that external flash which is on the Core where we’re restoring all these external binaries of when you’re downloading OTA updates and when you have a factory reset. (We keep a backup just in case the OTA didn’t go well.)</p>

<p>We had all those things in that external flash, on the Core. On the Photon, we lost all that space and the firmware team, mostly Mat (@mdma on the forums), did an astounding job earlier this year-- last year, time flies-- figuring out how to squeeze all functionality that we need into that internal flash. One of the ways that we managed to do that is, instead of having many copies of this huge binary including Broadcom’s WICED libraries (which are bigger than our firmware ever was), we just keep 1 copy of those things and then have multiple copies of very, very tiny user application and that let us keep all the basic functionality that we had on the Core in a much smaller flash space.</p>

<p>What this meant is that those system firmware images, they are separate. They’re their own binaries and they live in a certain flash space. When you build your user app, it is linking against those libraries. It says when I want to call digitalwrite, your app doesn’t necessarily know-- That’s a bad example, not technically correct but I’ll just go with it. When you call digitalwrite, the definition of digitalwrite might not be in your firmware. It just says like, “Oh, okay. digitalwrite, I know how to get that. That’s over here in the system firmware.”</p>

<p>You didn’t have to have all that code bundled into your user app. What that also means is that-- On the Core, every time we released an update, we’d put in the Build IDE. We would say like, “Hey, latest firmware is out.&quot; We mark in the sidebar there saying here’s what you’re building with, and you do your flash, and you build with the latest. You build that one monolithic binary with the latest.</p>

<p>When you flash a new user app on the Photon, there is a dependency chain between the user app depending on one of the system modules which depends on another system module. If you build a user app that needs a newer version of a system module, you can choose this in the devices drawer of the WebIDE. Then if you need a new version then we send you all 3 of those separate binaries and it will send you one of the binaries. It can be really big. It’ll take a long time to OTA, but then it’ll reboot and it’ll say, “Okay, now I’ve got the latest system part 1.” Same thing will happen again in system part 2, and then finally it’ll send your user app and everything will work as expected and you’ll have the latest system code, which is all the things that people at Particle are writing day to day.</p>

<p>That might mean that those flashes where you actually have to update those are longer than you expect. That’s a thing where we have to manage the expectations of people. Normally, you get this 1 second, 3 second, flash for user apps. But when you do have to update the system firmware, it’s much bigger than it was on the Core and it takes a long time. People may have seen <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/photon/#safe-mode">Safe Mode</a>-- you see a Photon, that boots up and gets on and seems like it’s on the cloud but it’s breathing magenta (breathing pink). If you don’t know what that means, that’s Safe Mode.</p>

<p>That means, it is connected to the cloud but your user app is not running because that dependency chain is not met. Your user app needs a newer version of the system modules than is there. One of the problems that we’re working on this Sprint, we have a couple of developers working really hard to get people automatically out of that state. If you understand it, if you know, you can always just manually do <code>particle update</code> using the CLI to get the latest system modules, or you can even over the air update those system modules and you will then get out of Safe Mode, but for some people that is complicated. It’s confusing. It takes a long time. They may even reset in the middle because it seems to be taking too long. We’re going to automatically fix that as fast as we can, as soon as we can, hopefully at the end of the spring.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Awesome. That was a very technically heavy question so I’m going to ask a technically lighter question.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Which is: for people out there who are starting to learn Electronics who just picked up-- like their friend got them a Core of Photon, and this is really the first time that they’re messing around. What kind of advice do you have for them?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Let me see. When we ask me questions, I answer with all the deep technical jargon and stuff. I think some people in the community, they hunger for that. They want some of that information. The thing is, you don’t need to know any of that to get started with electronics. On Particle, it’s so easy. Last time, Dick said “Get a button, get a Photon, get a button.” I totally agree. The <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/button">Internet Button</a> has buttons, it has LEDs, it has an accelerometer, and it has a buzzer. It’s like lights and sound and I can pick it up and move it around and I can push buttons.</p>

<p>There’s so many projects that people do. They’re just getting started, and they have an idea and they want to build it. So many projects can be built with the button. It’s so great. Dick did such an amazing job designing that. The libraries for it are super easy to use. Your code can be so short. You open up a web page-- <a href="http://build.particle.io">build.particle.io</a>-- and you [go to Libraries and] click <a href="https://build.particle.io/libs/55e0a4256b6e3275580009ce/tab/1_Blink_An_LED.cpp">InternetButton</a> and you say, “Yeah. Use this example and you flash it and even looking at the example if you don’t know much about it. It’s just like 15 lines of code. It’s very, very short. I love those comments explaining what’s going on.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/button-library.png"></div>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> It’s just so easy and it’s wireless and it’s magic. You can start to really learn just seeing what value is on the pins, watch it change when I touch my Photon pins and just watch the analog read input. It’s so satisfying to be able to just hit some buttons, watch the lights turn on. And I think people can learn a lot really fast.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. I remember the first time I was doing electronics was actually here at Particle and I wanted to do it for a really long time and it was my first day of work and Zach Supalla said--</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Is this before we had robot onboarding process?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Right. Now, everybody has built a robot. This was before then. It was my first day work. I was hanging out in the way, way old offices out on Potrero Hill. It was like the end of the day and you were doing some very technical stuff and I said, “Can I have a Core?” You pulled it out of your bag and unclaimed it and you handed it to me, and I just spent several hours playing with the Core and nothing but a wire.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It was brilliant. It was so much fun. I’m intensely jealous of individuals who now get to play with a button, because I think that that’s probably a much more fun experience not that that was fantastically fun. I thought it was very, very magical, but different.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I really like the accelerometer that moves with the button where it can just be like, “It’s like the light has gravity. It has weight. It’s just like it&#39;s falling to the bottom.”</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That’s one fun. I really enjoyed hooking the accelerometer up to the buzzer. The new ones have a buzzer.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I actually hadn’t played with one of those.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It makes a lot of noise so you turn it around. It’s like [makes button noises]. Then if you flick it, it screams, almost as though in protest, which is really funny to me. Speaking of those kind of getting started and doing these different projects, what are some of the Particle past projects that you’ve made, that you’ve really liked?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> See, this is a little bit of a tragedy. I haven’t made very many Particle-powered projects. I’m so busy building the platform and helping the team build the platform that I haven’t built much myself. Womp womp.</p>

<p>I did over this past holiday break back in December. I set for myself a project to essentially stream audio. I was going to make an app on my computer that I could just load up an audio file, whatever, song, and hit play and it would stream it over just over UDP on the local Wi-Fi to my Photon plugged in to my stereo system and make my own little like do-it-yourself Sonos. I was actually doing it with the Core at that time.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I bought this digital audio converter deck chip that was so tiny. I did my best. I came in here, used the soldering iron, and did my best to debug this tiny, tiny chip. I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t make it happen and so eventually I gave up on it. I wasn’t able to actually make it happen because I had bought a deck that was not suitable for breadboarding and soldering. That was my one attempt that didn’t happen memorably. I mean, we’ve done internal hackathons and things and I always help with those but as far as my own personal... I got nothing.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We’re doing an internal hackathon next week, right?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> We area, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. That should be really exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yes. Lots of people. We have this onboarding process now at Particle where everybody who joins, it doesn’t matter if they are working on logistics and distribution and marketing or if they’re working on back-end code and infrastructure or if they’re actually making circuit designs. It doesn’t matter. Everybody has to make a robot. This is now part of the onboarding process at Particle. Actually, one of the Particle-powered companies out there, one of the companies building on our platform, has stolen this onboarding process. They make their employees build something with a Photon.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Really?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I didn’t know that. That’s delightful.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Now, everybody has to do this. However, there’s always just too much to do and sometimes people get through most of their onboarding and they start their robot but they don’t finish it. So next week in particular, we’re having a lot of the team in town. We do regularly coming from all over the US and coming to San Francisco. And lots of people are going to finish their robots, and the rest of the team also will build whatever comes to mind.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That is going to be really fun. I feel like I’m going to have to think of something since my robot experience was the thing with the wire when I first started and I’ve built other stuff since then. I feel like I should really participate in this heavily.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> And now the Photon has to genuine analog outputs to DACs. Now, I can make my project with just a Photon and the jack to plug in to the stereo.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> You should have a contest to see whether you can finish that before Zach finishes <a href="https://github.com/zsup/charm">his drone</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Cool. It is slightly early for this but I could probably just start... I usually just start taking questions at 4:30. I probably can actually pull some of it now because it looks like some people are writing.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Oh, nice. Like Dick, I tend to give concise answers.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let’s see. &quot;Any ideas for using Photons with my bike?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Okay. Obviously, it’s going to be battery-powered. I’m going to stumble over some power bricks. Let’s see. On a bike, battery-powered. It’s going to be moving around. Not a reliable Wi-Fi connection around, so the kind of thing you would want to do is something so that when it joins your network at home like when you park it at home or at the office or both, that it does something there. If you have a plug near where you park it at home and where you park it at work, then that it could be a security system of sorts, like if my Photon is online, the bike is placed. I suppose they could just take it off. That doesn’t make any sense. If a person wants to steal a bike, they take the Photon off. Take the bike.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> At least you can hide it.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah, hide it. Attach it really, really strongly. Let’s see. You could do the <a href="https://www.hackster.io/neo-phreak-3/warkitteh">WarKitteh</a> thing. Just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">wardriving</a> while you’re driving around town. Gather the list of the open Wi-Fi networks and know them. Know where they are along your route, your commute or your typical leisure ride.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> You can make a map of the open Wi-Fi networks of San Francisco quite easily.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yes. Excellent idea. Then there are lights. There’s so many light projects. I have a pair of Revolights that somebody gave me that are sitting my hall at home. I haven’t put them on my bike. Perhaps why you asked this question-- I bike everywhere in San Francisco. Biking is my favorite way to get around. In fact we were way on the other side of San Francisco for a conference several months ago and Zach and Steph and maybe some other people jumped in the Uber, and I hopped on my bike. I got here way before they did. All the way across San Francisco. It was maybe four or five miles, something like this, and I got here in maybe 20 minutes and they got here in 30 plus. Biking is definitely the best way to get around many cities including San Francisco.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Just the hills in San Francisco that you have to avoid primarily.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah. Either avoid or be mentally and physically prepared for.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> That’s true. You could just be really in shape or really know how to use your gears. Let’s see. Another question.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Not that I have the gears.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> &quot;Is the Photon a microcontroller or is it a dev kit?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> It is a dev kit. The Photon contains a microcontroller. The microcontroller is from STMicroelectronics, STM32F205. It’s just an ARM Cortex-M3. So it contains a microcontroller. That is where all of the code runs. It has the memory. It has the flash-- when you are using DFU utility to flash code to your Photon, that’s getting written to flash that’s inside that little microcontroller. But it’s a dev kit because it’s a circuit board that has that microcontroller and other things on it. You could buy all those parts yourself, and the hardware designs are open-source, and you can make it yourself. But it’s way easier to just buy it from us. We’ve got the manufacturing supply chain set up for it so it’s definitely cheaper to buy from us than to make it yourself. Sometimes it’s a good learning experience but yeah. Definitely a dev kit.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I feel that way, yeah. Let’s see. Another question: &quot;How much of the Photon is open-source and open-hardware?&quot; Keeping in mind that no modern computer is ever fully open.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Sure. ST doesn’t provide their silicon designs as far as I know. It does function to a certain spec obviously, ARM licenses these designs but I wouldn’t know where to go find the silicon design for that. How much of it? Power, PCB design (like Eagle files). The list of all the components that go on there such that you could buy them yourself and build a Photon yourself. To what extent is a capacitor open-source? That’s getting pretty esoteric. I don&#39;t know. We know how those work. If you want to make your own capacitor, I’m sure there are probably ways on the internet, some YouTube videos to build your own capacitor out of X and Y.</p>

<p>Really the important components that the person asking the question actually cares about are the microcontroller-- which we don’t have the internal designs for-- and the Wi-Fi module from Broadcom-- similarly don’t have the internal designs for as far as open-source. Everything we’re doing there is totally open, but the people we’re buying components from, companies, theirs are not open-source.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/novena">Novena</a> is a laptop project that was on Crowd Supply for by Bunnie Huang and I forget his collaborator’s name, but they were trying to make a completely, as far as they could, open-source laptop. I backed that project for a t-shirt. The laptop itself was a bit expensive but I admire Bunnie a lot, and that project is pushing the boundaries and others are doing similar things now. As far as software, all the firmware that is on the Photon-- again that <em>we</em> write-- is open-source, and especially our encryption library is open-source. When we built the Core, that was very important to us. It’s called TropicSLL. It’s an earlier fork of what is now called PolarSLLs. PolarSSL is descendant of this and it&#39;s closed source. TropicSLL is a fork I think has a BSD lessons. There are firmware components that are typically very hard to find open-source, that we cared a lot about that and pushed to make sure that we had an open-source encryption stack.</p>

<p>Now inside WICED, Broadcom, I want to say, thanks to us-- I’m sure they were already planning it and others were pushing for it too-- but certainly in response to a lot of prodding, they released WICED, the parts that they can, the parts that they write under an open-source license, they&#39;re on the Broadcom open license so something their lawyers could check off on. That’s great. Also then, that’s what allowed us to include the WICED files in our firmware repo so that everybody can see how some of that stuff works. There are things of course that Broadcom then uses other libraries that they use that they don’t have the right to open-source. Those things are still in there as a proprietary just a binary blob.</p>

<p>The final to your question, it’s about as open-source as you can get with something like this, because we cared deeply about supporting the open-source community and doing these things out in the open, especially when it comes to security which is something that everyone in the internet of things should be concerned about and not too many are. I read an article the other day about internet-connected baby monitors are basically just all completely open to easy hacking. FYI. Fear.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Fear. It’s definitely terrifying.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let’s see. Alex was asking follow-ups on the bike question, which is: &quot;What is the easiest way to hook lights up to the Photon?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Lights. The easiest way is to get  the internet button but let’s see. Pixel strips, you can buy those off of <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1376">Adafruit</a> and <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12021">Sparkfun</a>, and those are super easy. That’s basically what is on the button, that you can buy strips of them and you drive them off in I2C bus so yeah, that’s the easy way.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Garret asks, “How did you get started with Particle and/or how did you meet Zach and/or what did you do before Particle?”</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> All of the above, okay. Before Particle, I was a freelance developer for 10-ish years, 10+. And that was web stuff and desktop stuff and mobile stuff, all over the map. I was helping individual people and artists and nonprofits and big companies and small companies to make their lives better with code. I was often the kind of person who’d be called in when a project was going down the tubes and I&#39;d like, swoop in, get everybody on the same page, and deliver something that fit within their monetary and temporal constraints, and get them what they need and help people understand and have the right expectations of what could be built within their constraints.</p>

<p>I think that’s something that a lot of freelance developers don’t do that well-- is just set the expectations well upfront. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">agile processes</a> obviously help with that if you know about those things. Let’s see. That’s what I was doing before Particle. I was also going to school. I gone to a lot of school like Christine. In 2012, fast forward to about the time we&#39;re starting Particle. I am contracting to being a contract developer for some startups in a coworking space in Minneapolis called CoCo. That’s great. We still have people. The Minneapolis team still works out of CoCo.</p>

<p>I’m contracting with some startups there and finishing my PhD. I get my PhD in music composition, in February of that year. Little after that, Zach moves to Minneapolis and starts working that coworking space. It’s a big room, lots of people working. Everybody has got their headphones on, heads-down. But CoCo great to encourage everyone to get up, off their butts, meet each other. They had a thing called &quot;Beer and Chat,&quot; which essentially was just once a week, make everybody get out of their seats and talk to all the people around them. There were lots of good events like that.</p>

<p>Zach and I met at a Beer and Chat. Just sit down. They’re just mingling. And be like, “Hey. I’m Zach.” “Oh, so am I. Okay. Yeah, nice. Cute.” He was at a stage with his idea that was becoming the Socket, the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/11/spark-devices-connects-your-regular-old-light-bulbs-to-the-internet/">Spark Socket</a> if anybody knows the ancient history. And he was at a stage where he was looking for a co-founder, and we did hit it off pretty well. We get along really well. We have really complimentary skills and mindsets.</p>

<p>We just worked together really well. We did some small projects together, brainstorming, whiteboarding some things, building some proof of concept stuff and we decided to make it official and yeah, signed some paperwork and dove headlong into trying to make the Spark Socket a reality. It was in summer and fall 2012. Did that answer all of the questions?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I think so.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Was that Garrett?</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Pretty much. Yeah. That looks like most of that.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Sweet.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> The next question down the list actually is something that I think is important to answer which is first, a really sweet compliment from BulldogLowell which is, “Thanks for a great platform. You should be proud.&quot; Hey, <em>you</em> should be proud of being such an awesome person on the community because I see you there all the time. &quot;Do you see commercial customers in the fleet development overshadowing the old maker community as the company moves forward?”</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Sure. Absolutely not. It’s a totally legit question. I understand where people are coming from on that.</p>

<p>Everybody wants us to be as successful. Everybody in terms of Particle and everybody in the community and the businesses that are building fleets of products on Particle. It’s in everyone’s best interest if we’re successful and everybody understands that means we have to make money, right? We have worked very, very hard. Zach and I have had long discussions about this to stay true to our open-source routes and continue to push the boundaries of what can be open-source and commercial, because people often think of these as two separate things and they’re not. They’re absolutely not.</p>

<p>We just have to make the licenses friendly for those who want to make closed products while keeping the development of our platform as open sourced as possible and we need to provide enough value. We need to make the product good enough, better and better every day, and everybody at Particle is always just striving so hard to make the product better, better, better and better. Everybody wants it so bad that it’s wonderful. I work with an amazing team of people. We have to provide enough value that people are willing to pay for what we do.</p>

<p>Obviously the maker community, anybody who’s building one or two things or like, outfitting their house with something-- they’re going to buy less from us and spend less money than some big company that comes along and says, “Hey, we have an idea for connected thing. We really want to build this out. We need your help.” We are hiring more people who are on the sales and customer success side of things to help those companies. I don’t mean more hiring right now. I mean, the plan for hiring, I should say, is to keep building out all parts of the business so that we continue supporting everybody who is making things for themselves-- DIY projects and things for their family and their friends-- as well as put the company on a really solid footing on the future by making a lot of those same tools really outstanding for the companies, big and small, who are deploying products on Particle.</p>

<p>I don’t see it overshadowing. We’re growing as we grow. We are going to grow in both directions. There are different resources that sometimes require you to support one set of users versus another, but we are constantly aiming to just make the support of all of our community-- both the individual makers and the companies big and small. Just make the experience better and better, and support them as best as we can. So definitely not overshadowing.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> The next question: &quot;Is there any news regarding WICED TLS/SLL support or WolfSLL from FreeRTOS?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Not in my head right at this particular second. That’s a good one for the community and you could ping me, @zachary and you could ping @mdma. Mat has probably the closest contact, with our friends over at Broadcom, and the whole firmware team works to figure out what’s the right approach. We always want to make sure we have an open-source encryption option, and obviously part of anything that’s part of FreeRTOS would also be open-source. I don&#39;t know about the WICED TLS support. I would presume that there would be closed parts but maybe not. I’m not sure. No news on it. For the Electron, we’re getting close to just using existing libraries for DTLS support, TLS support over UDP. It’ll be closer to standard TLS spec. Yeah, I’ll stop. That’s a great question. There’s a lot of good discussion to be had there but I don’t have any amazing info to drop.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Do we know when WifiScan() is going to be released? Because that library was so fun.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I don&#39;t know. Although I do have the firmware releases page open. We’re planning to release 0.4.5 for the Photon as well as for the Core, although it won’t be selected by default for the Core. Today, maybe tomorrow, sometime this week. I see a prerelease boot loader update up on the releases page now. Oh, that was from 7 days ago though. Yeah, that release has not been fully filled out yet so I’d have to go look at the changed log but I know we’re leasing this week that has a whole bunch of changes in it, a whole bunch of small changes. This was about WifiScan. I don’t actually know whether WifiScan is in that or not.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I know it’s definitely been talked about. I’m not sure if it was implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Exactly. I am mentioning because there’s a chance it’s in there but I don&#39;t know for certain. We often get some flex here and there for pushing really hard on feature development at the expense of stability and bug fixes, and I’d say there is some truth to that. I would say when bug fixes are important enough, we do prioritize them over feature development. But in general we try to focus on providing the most value to the most people.</p>

<p>I mean, a lot of times it’s feature development and sometimes it’s bug fixes. This firmware update that we’re releasing this week, I think has 50 plus bugs fixed in it, just tons and tons of small things. There’s a little response to that perfectly valid criticism that we hear every once in a while.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Yeah. A question that came up was can the Photon be used with Wi-Fi Direct?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Wi-Fi Direct. I need to go find a specification for Wi-Fi Direct. I won’t tell you what I think Wi-Fi Direct is and I would love for somebody to tell me I’m wrong, I think that our SoftAP setup process is Wi-Fi Direct that basically you make a direct Wi-Fi connection between 2 devices where in this case the Photon advertises a network and then your mobile phone or your computer, whatever it is connects to that network and then does whatever you like by default the Photon as 192.168.0.1. That’s a common local subnet IP address and so then if you use a TCP server to listen on a certain port, you can then connect to that port over that connection.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the answer is yes because that’s Wi-Fi Direct. It’s a term that people throw around as though it’s something different, more complex, more advanced than that. I look forward to hearing more and I’ll put it on my to-do list to go find a spec for that and read it.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> There was a question which was: &quot;Are there any technical documentations about the modular firmware build system like the Photons to be found anywhere, so that perhaps we could do some inception and set up a modular user application?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> A modular user application. Dreams within dreams. Firmware within firmware. There is almost certainly some documentation about that. Right off the top of my head, I don&#39;t know where it is. If I were going to guess, I would go to GitHub to the firmware repo. I would make sure I’m on a <code>develop</code> branch and I would look at the readme there. Module descriptor linking and retrieval is a link there. Modules. Bootloader overview and internals. Let’s see, so that’s specific. The bootloader is one of the modules so that’s what is, and the cloud communications is the former communication library that was separate and pulled in to the firmware repo. The communication library is in one of the modules. The module descriptor linking and retrieval is actually something separate.</p>

<p>How about this? I will say probably not if I can’t find it immediately and I will put it on my list to make sure that that gets documented somewhere. I know there are documents somewhere that maybe we only had internally so we’ll put them up in a public place because that’s useful if you are the kind of person who wants to dig and it will have to be a little hidden because it’s really just confusing for someone who is just trying to get started so we want to make sure not to scare people but we’ll be sure and put that up in a place where you can find it.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> We can definitely link that to the blog post that comes up with the transcript of this interview.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I’ll state it.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> One person has asked, “Will I be able to access the baseband radio on the Electron?”</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> On the Electron, no, I don’t believe so. The only interface we have is to the u-blox module is through AT commands over a serial interface. So no.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> It turns out that WifiScan according to Mat is in fact ready and documented for 0.4.5 which I’m super excited about!!</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Thank you, Mat.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Thanks, Mat. People are wondering how they can update to 0.4.5?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> There will be a few ways so you can do it over the wire, DFU. Think about, do you want to do this over USB cable or do you want to do it over the air? If you want to do it over the air, which is the simple thing, then open up the Build IDE, go find your devices. You open up the device drawer. Find your device and expand it. There’s a little drop down where you get to choose which version of the system firmware you want.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/build-firmware-dropdown.png"></div>

<p>If you change that to 0.4.5, once that’s available (once it appears in that list), then the next time you flash any app, you’ll have this very long flash because you will be getting an overview update of the system modules as well as your user app. That’s one way. That’s the easy way and if you find there are problems and you just want to go back to the old version, all you have to do is change that drop down and you’re good to go back on the firmware you know and love.</p>

<p>If you want to do it over USB cable, I think the easiest thing is to use the <code>particle update</code> command. As soon as we have those binaries, we will put them into the CLI and once we update the CLI with the 0.4.5 binaries then you can update your version of the CLI, make sure you get the latest and then call <code>particle update</code> with your Photon plugged in.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> When I do this, it’s just going to detect whatever Photon is currently plugged in to my USB on my computer and update that, or do I need to add any more syntax past <code>particle update</code>?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> I think it’s just <code>particle update</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah. Correct me if I’m wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Let’s see. I think that everyone is still catching up with us because there is about a 30-second lag, but that is pretty great. Do you want to talk about your musical abilities and strange concentration of musical humans at Particle?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah, there is. It’s outstanding. I think it’s the best thing ever. I am a composer. I’m going to verify that the website I’m about to say actually does exists. It’s <a href="http://zacharycrockett.com/">horrible but it exists</a>.</p>

<div class="full"><img src="http://spark.github.io/staging-blog/images/zachary-website.png"></div>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Wow. That website is very, like, 2004.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yeah. That’s probably the last time I updated it. Since 2012. It was just how I rolled but in any case, my name dot com was primarily used as a place for me to post as a composer. So I’m a composer and do electronic music and acoustic music. Electro-acoustic music where you write computer programs. Onstage would be a computer with a microphone and some speakers and a performer or more performers, more computers.</p>

<p>The computer just becomes another one of the performers and so you write software that can let these different players interact. There’s one called a saxophone and a computer piece called <em>Fight to Flow Between</em> that I wrote that has gotten a lot of play and particularly there’s a saxophonist, an outstanding saxophonist named Eric Honour who toured around the world several years ago. My favorite piece, if you actually are listening and actually go to that website which I haven’t, like I said, updated in years and years. I have not touched. A little bit embarrassing but that’s okay. My favorite piece is called <em>Fire: Their Voices Cracked</em>. It’s for 6 saxophones, 4 percussionists and a didgeridoo and it’s awesome. I wrote it, now almost 15 years ago. It’s good. I like creating rituals and dances in musical form. My PhD was a collaboration with a choreographer in Minneapolis. I also play in an electro-acoustic improv quartet of composers called Earworm. I’ll let you do the Googling if you care. We haven’t played a gig in a while. We’re going to do one in early 2016 somewhere in Rhode Island, I think.</p>

<p>Yeah, and the strange concentration of musical humans at Particle. Out of our 25 to 30 people there are very few who would say a sentence like “Oh, I’m not musical or I don’t have any musical ability.” Very, very few. Almost everybody like sings, or plays cello, or is a composer, plays piano, plays drums, plays bass. We’ve talked about how we need to have-- there are actually too many people. We need multiple bands actually. It’s obviously on the backburner because we haven’t done anything about it but, yeah, bands, a capella groups, something. We need to make more musical things happen at Particle.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Before I go back to a couple more questions, I wanted to ask you a specific question about the piece you were just referring to with the many saxophones and the Australian instrument which was: Did you originally write it with all those instruments there?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Yes, exactly. The conception of the piece before it was written was six saxophones and it’s the whole range, so it’s one bari, two tenors, two alto and one soprano. Four percussionists. ONe of them plays wood, one plays metal and one plays skin drum type things, and each of them has some small things, medium sized things, and some big things, and the didgeridoo. That was all part of it. I was spending a lot of time in libraries in Europe and the US and reading Aztec codices. It was fanatically related to Aztec rituals and campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> I was just curious because I thought, maybe after the first draft, I was going to ask-- <em>did you redo</em> it after the first draft? Get it?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Didgeridoo. Did you redo. I want to pour this on your head.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Sorry. Greg is asking: how secure is the communication between the Particle cloud and the Photons and would it be possible for someone to sniff my code and find out where the encryption keys are stored?</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> It is very secured. This is something we cared about and I personally cared deeply about from the beginning. Now, here’s the one caveat. If someone has physical access to the device, if they’re holding it in their hand and they can touch wires to it and they can plug things into it, they can get whatever they want so we can’t prevent that. But if someone does not have physical access, and you’re talking about people just sniffing the airwaves, the connection between a Core or a Photon or a P1 or an Electron in the cloud is encrypted. For the hand waving, I’ll just say it’s encrypted with TLS.</p>

<p>For those of you who want more detail, in the <a href="https://github.com/spark/core-communication-lib">communication library part of the firmware</a>, there is a security overview. What TLS actually is, is it’s a negotiation protocol between 2 parties to say like, “Hey, I support these things.&quot; &quot;Oh, really? I support these things. Do you want to talk this?&quot; &quot;Yeah. I think that’s a good idea. No, maybe not. Let’s try this one.” There’s always negotiation to decide what cipher suite you want to use to encrypt the connection.</p>

<p>We write the firmware and we write the cloud. There is absolutely no need-- It’s an utter waste to have all of that traffic for negotiation. We just pick one and it’s a reliable one. On the Core, and the Photon, and P1, right now, the device has a 1024-bit RSA key-pair. (I’ll go through this quick so we don’t bore too many people.) The cloud has a 2048-bit RSA key-pair. The private keys are private to those things, never leave them. The public keys are exchanged so the cloud has a copy of all the device public keys. The device has a copy of the cloud public key. You can go download the cloud public key. There are links to it around the community. We used RSA to get an initial handshake a way to send a small secret back and forth. And the secret that we send is an encryption key for an AES 128 CBC connection. There are more details than that. There’s a SHA-1 HMAC and there’s all these things. You can go read more if you dig in to the communication folder of the developed branch of firmware and see the security overview that’s in the <a href="https://github.com/spark/firmware/blob/develop/communication/README.md">readme</a> but it’s encrypted as securely as your typical bank website.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Cool. That sounds pretty good. I feel safe.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Good.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Feel safe and warm. I feel I’m wrapped in a snuggie.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> That’s what we want for you as a product creator. That’s what we want our customers to feel like.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> Cool. We’re about 5:00 so I’m going to shut down the broadcast, but thank you so much for spending the time to talk to me and to the community.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> Absolutely my pleasure. You have the awesomeness for doing these and you are the awesomeness for watching and listening.</p>

<p><strong>Christine:</strong> All right. Cool. Bye, guys. I will see you next time.</p>

<p><strong>Zachary:</strong> See you around the community.</p>
